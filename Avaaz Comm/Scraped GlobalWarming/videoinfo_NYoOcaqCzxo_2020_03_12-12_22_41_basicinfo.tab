title	Fatal Flaw In Climate Change Science
description	We must stop pollution for reasons of biosphere toxicity, NOT because of climate change. The TSI model of solar forcing ignores nearly all climate forcing aspects of space weather AND applies that forcing to the human total. This video shows that fact in a way that anyone can understand. DEMAND THAT NOAA AND THE IPCC: (1) USE 'PARTICLE FORCING' AND EXPAND SOLAR DATA TO INCLUDE X-RAYS, SOLAR WIND, AND HIGH-ENERGY PROTONS. (2) CEASE OF DECEPTIVE PRACTICES LIKE ONLY SHOWING SPRING SNOW COVER, AND NOT 'COUNTING' SOLAR PHYSICISTS AS 'CLIMATE SCIENTISTS' IN THEIR "97%" ANALYSIS. (3) STOP PRETENDING CLIMATE CHANGE BEGAN IN 1850, THERE IS ROBUST DATA GOING WELL INTO THE PAST. climate-understandingclimate@noaa.gov https://twitter.com/NOAAClimate https://twitter.com/ipcc_ch https://www.facebook.com/IPCC Pollution sucks. It's just that, presently, climate science does too.
