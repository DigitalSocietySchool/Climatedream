You could feed every datapoint even potentially related to climate into an AI, feed it the warming data, and have it spit out the correlations and predictions.

There is no climate model that can 100% accurately predict future climate. None. They are increasingly closer (less inaccurate), but increasingly close on quite small time scales, isn't really a statement of pure mathematical reproduction of a phenomena. Being able to model the past is less relevant than modelling the future. As we build more models, and test them, we are testing them on shorter timeframes. To say any science, particularly as complex as climate doesn't have uncertainties, like the IPCC's own admitted uncertainties modelling water vapour is to misrepresent the nature of science IMO. If they could indeed predict future climate, they would stop making new models. Personally I don't understand the argument about man-made versus natural. We know both contribute. We know its warming. The bigger issue is where it's going, and to what degree we can realistically alter that (and how). Those are all very complex areas, and quite important, so getting caught on the 'who farted' issue just seems like a waste of time. Even assuming it's all man made, there's no way people will stop flying, smelting, using heavy machinary, manufacturing and so on - that requires a fuck tonne of scientific invention to overcome. So even if you go there, you get caught between idiotic idealists who think govt taxation will solve the problem, deniers and the small number who understand the sheer amount of scientific growth required. And if it's somehow LESS man made than the IPCC predicts - that could be good. That might mean we have less catastrophic outcomes or have more time. Or maybe we are all fucked in an even shorter timeframe, and we should be making biodomes? For that matter do we know why the sun has been more active in the last 100 years than the last 8000? Asking questions is never a bad thing.	UChqJVfHliBRpMaOqht7vhOw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqJVfHliBRpMaOqht7vhOw	1	Ugzv-HbKpMvawvyZdoh4AaABAg	Suspicious0bservers

YOU actually believe there are only about 30 models??????????????????? There is hardly an issue of any International Climate / Science Journal that does expound about successful models in use! "How reliable are climate models? What the science says... . While there are uncertainties with climate models, they successfully reproduce the past and have made predictions that have been subsequently confirmed by Human Observations and Scientific Equipment Observations. Climate Myth... . ****Models are unreliable "[Models] are full of fudge factors that are fitted to the existing climate, so the models more or less agree with the observed data. But there is no reason to believe that the same fudge factors would give the right behavior in a world with different chemistry, for example in a world with increased CO2 in the atmosphere." (Freeman Dyson) There are two major questions in climate modeling - can they accurately reproduce the past (hindcasting) and can they successfully predict the future? To answer the first question, here is a summary of the IPCC model results of surface temperature from the 1800s - both with and without man-made forcings. All the models are unable to predict recent warming without taking rising CO2 levels into account. Nobody has created a general circulation model that can explain the climate's behavior over the past century without CO2 warming. . Predicting/projecting the future: A common argument heard is "scientists can't even predict the weather next week - how can they predict the climate years from now". This betrays a misunderstanding of the difference between weather, which is chaotic and unpredictable, and climate which is weather averaged out over time. While you can't predict with certainty whether a coin will land heads or tails, you can predict the statistical results of a large number of coin tosses. In weather terms, you can't predict the exact route a storm will take but the average temperature and precipitation over the whole region is the same regardless of the route. There are various difficulties in predicting future climate. The behavior of the sun is difficult to predict. Short-term disturbances like El Niño or volcanic eruptions are difficult to model. Nevertheless, the major forcings that drive climate are well understood. . A paper led by James Risbey (2014) in Nature Climate Change takes a clever approach to evaluate how accurate climate model temperature predictions have been while getting around the noise caused by natural cycles. The authors used a large set of simulations from 18 different climate models (from CMIP5). They looked at each 15-year period since the 1950s and compared how accurately each model simulation had represented El Niño and La Niña conditions during those 15 years, using the trends in what's known as the Niño3.4 index. . Each individual climate model run has a random representation of these natural ocean cycles, so for every 15-year period, some of those simulations will have accurately represented the actual El Niño conditions just by chance. The study authors compared the simulations that were correctly synchronized with the ocean cycles (blue data in the left frame below) and the most out-of-sync (grey data in the right frame) to the observed global surface temperature changes (red) for each 15-year period. Figure 2: Red: 15-year observed trends for each period. Blue: 15-year average trends from CMIP5 runs where the model Niño3.4 trend is close to observations. Grey: average 15-year trends for only the models with the worst correspondence to the Niño3.4 trend. The sizes of the dots are proportional to the number of models selected. From Nature Climate Change . The authors conclude, When the phase of natural variability is taken into account, the model 15-year warming trends in CMIP5 projections well estimate the observed trends for all 15-year periods over the past half-century. It's also clear from the grey figure that models that are out-of-sync with the observed changes in these ocean cycles simulate dramatically higher warming trends over the past 30 years. In other words, the model simulations that happened not to accurately represent these ocean cycles were the ones that over-predicted global surface warming. Climate models have also been accurately projecting global surface temperature changes for over 40 years. Climate contrarians have not: Figure 3: Various global temperature projections by mainstream climate scientists and models, and by climate contrarians, compared to observations by NASA GISS. Created by Dana Nuccitelli. Uncertainties in future projections A common misconception is that climate models are biased towards exaggerating the effects of CO2. It bears mentioning that uncertainty can go either way. In fact, in a climate system with net positive feedback, uncertainty is skewed more towards a stronger climate response (Roe 2007). For this reason, many of the IPCC predictions have subsequently been shown to underestimate the climate response. Satellite and tide-gauge measurements show that sea-level rise is accelerating faster than IPCC predictions. The average rate of rising for 1993-2008 as measured from the satellite is 3.4 millimeters per year while the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) projected the best estimate of 1.9 millimeters per year for the same period. Observations are tracking along with the upper range of IPCC sea-level projections. Figure 4: Observed sea level rise since 1970 from tide gauge data (red) and satellite measurements (blue) compared to model projections for 1990-2010 from the IPCC Third Assessment Report (grey band). (Source: The Copenhagen Diagnosis, 2009) Similarly, the summertime melting of Arctic sea-ice has accelerated far beyond the expectations of climate models. The area of sea-ice melt during 2007-2009 was about 40% greater than the average prediction from IPCC AR4 climate models. The thickness of Arctic sea ice has also been on a steady decline over the last several decades. Figure 5: Comparison of observed September minimum Arctic sea ice extent through 2008 (red line) with IPCC AR4 model projections. The solid black line shows the mean of the 13 models and dashed black lines show the range of the model results. The 2009 minimum was calculated at 5.10 million km2, the third-lowest year on record and still well below the IPCC worst-case scenario. (Source: Copenhagen Diagnosis, 2009) There's one chart often used to argue to the contrary, but it's got some serious problems and ignores most of the data. Do we know enough to act? Skeptics argue that we should wait until climate models are completely certain before we act on reducing CO2 emissions. If we waited for 100% certainty, we would never act. Models are in a constant state of development to include more processes, rely on fewer approximations and increase their resolution as computer power develops. The complex and non-linear nature of climate means there will always be a process of refinement and improvement. The main point is we now know enough to act. Models have evolved to the point where they successfully predict long-term trends and are now developing the ability to predict more chaotic, short-term changes. Multiple lines of evidence, both modeled and empirical, tell us global temperatures will change 3°C with a doubling of CO2 (Knutti & Hegerl 2008). Models don't need to be exact in every respect to give us an accurate overall trend and its major effects - and we have that now. If you knew there was a 90% chance you'd be in a car crash, you wouldn't get in the car (or at the very least, you'd wear a seatbelt). The IPCC concludes, with a greater than 90% probability, that humans are causing global warming. To wait for 100% certainty before acting is recklessly irresponsible."

If you have to dismiss all of these scientific organizations to reach your opinion, then you are by definition denying the science" This is a wrong way to think about factual science. First of all, it is no good just blaming those who are opposed to the decline of fossil fuels for all skepticism on the climate consensus. They are NOT the only skeptics! For example, I am very aware of environmental issues as an ex scientist (marine biologist) and I would be pleased if we can solve and stop pollution problems occurring. Heavy metals, PCB's and millions of tons of benzene chemicals are released each year. Not to mention plastics. Where it all goes is of great concern. Some of this IS CAUSING MORE CANCERS, it appears beyond much doubt. Many of us know perfectly well there there could be a small but significant risk of adding climate loading factors by man-made outputs. It would also be great if we can reduce USAGE of all these fuels. Man is very wasteful of all God given resources, which are finite. We want to be more economical we should not be driving around in machine which barely get 25 MPG. There is room for legislation I believe to make all transport far far more efficient. And I don't mean just by conversion to electrical, though that would be good in cities where renewable sources are used. JUST remember there are political forces on both sides and if you don't yet understand how, I would recommend reading a little more widely. The Democrat case in America is well supported by Climate Change Fear enthusiasts. However, the RAW DATA would not justify ANY fear at all, at present. Hence my reasons for being more concerned with toxic pollution than CO2. CO2 is not toxic substance and of course is essential for life. That does not mean we go on allowing it to build up forever, but that we control the amount we produce. But did you know what we have done? We have increased CO2 on Earth from 0.02% to just 0.04% Yes, that is small. CO2 is only 1/ 25th fraction of ONE PERCENT of our atmosphere. Truly tiny. There is certainly NO statistically significant risk of pushing the temperature up by nearly TEN PERCENT where the CO2 level increases by a one 1/50th of 1% (THIS IS THE TINY INCREASE THAT WE HAVE ADD AND CANNOT ALLOW SIGNIFICANT WARMING). This is the science fact. Let's not do science fiction. We MUST do our part to look after the Earth for its species and prevent all toxic pollution. We don't "deny organizations" or science. What we want to critique (which is what scientific technique and discussion does and is purposed for) is the lack of openness, and the lack of credulous examination of real data, when compared to climate change predictions. There a hundreds of both climate scientists and high qualified other scientists who agree that this has now gone too far and the witch hunt from both side should be called to halt. WE NEED GOOD DATA. WHY CAN'T WE STOP ARGUING AND GO GET IT! POLITICS. THAT IS WHY. We are losing time on argument and need to fund the right studies. Meantime, let's make sure we don't take our eye off the gross industrial pollution problems, and the over-fishing, etc. These are greater immediate dangers.

Some is used, and when so, NONE Of the data meet the model data at all. The models, in every case, except one, are wrong. It's unfortunately the case that scientists, one they have a theory they will stick with it until it has to be killed off. It is getting to point where this must be done. The models ARE flawed. The actual live data do not show significant warming when compared to historical natural variability over 200- 300 years or more.

Below are some linked articles that most viewers have never encountered, or which are rejected off-hand, by the vast majority of the earth's still rapidly growing human population of 7.7 billion people. Most humans feel quite separate from all the other millions of species of life, including our closest animal cousins. Human hubris prevents most people from accepting the concept that there may be things we can't engineer our way out of. It is also hard for many to accept the concept that we may have long ago passed a threshold beyond which we we could turn things around. Hope springs eternal.

To suggest that this claim is true is is a bold-face lie. This presenter's aim is to deliberately mislead his audience to make it appear the rest of his presentation demonstrates the mainstream science is not to be believed. Climate science deniers have convinced themselves that all the mountains of empirical evidence, gathered during the past three decades by a broad range of scientific disciplines studying Anthropogenic Climate Disruption (ACD) effects around the globe, is faulty. This video provides no mention of who the speaker is. Apparently it is Ben Davidson who created the SuspiciousObservers YouTube Channel. Mr. Davidson has had no formal science training which is the case for the vast majority of the tribal followers of climate science denial. Although they label themselves as skeptics most of them are highly unlikely to critically examine what they have been drawn to. The vast majority are only interested in gathering information that reenforces their pre-existing deeply entrenched worldview, that involves some degree of conspiracy theory.

The discovery of Murcury's magnetosphere while not strong enough to retain atmosphere has forced us to re-evaluate its climate. Venus wind speeds have increased 33%. Earths climate is going crazy.

These alphabet soup of organizations include NASA, NOAA, JMA, WMO, NSIDC, IPCC, UK Met Office, and others. Click on the names for links to their climate-related sites. There are also climate research organizations associated with universities. These are all legitimate scientific sources. If you have to dismiss all of these scientific organizations to reach your opinion, then you are by definition denying the science. If you have to believe that all of these organizations, and all of the climate scientists around the world, and all of the hundred thousand published research papers, and physics, are all somehow part of a global, multigenerational conspiracy to defraud the people, then you are, again, a denier by definition.  So if you deny all the above scientific organizations there are a lot of un-scientific web sites out there that pretend to be science.

Jimmy Swaggert. <br />1799 <br />Alexander von Humboldt studied, worried and postulated that Human Activites / Pollution would CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE! <br />Strip Mining entire mountain tops, Clear Cutting entire Forests, burning Coal/Peat/Wood/Oil, building huge cities which have their own climates <br />. <br />The First USE of &quot; CLIMATE CHANGE &quot;, the definition of which is still in use today. <br />1799 <br />Thomas Jefferson also penned a paper on observed climate changes which he stated was probably caused by man...and had many discussions with John Adams <br />on these climate changes. <br />1804 <br />Thomas Jefferson(scientist/philosopher/politician) On Climate Change | Real Science-----&gt; “A change in our climate is taking place very surely. Both heat and cold are becoming moderate within the memory of even the middle-aged, and snows are less frequent and less deep.” <br />1811 <br />French Science Tied Warming, Climate Changes directly to Human Activities &amp; Industrialization. <br />1824 <br />Jean-Baptiste Fourier calculates that the Earth would be far colder if it lacked an atmosphere. <br />Certainly, <br />&quot;...Tyndall’s equipment, laboratory and experimental results were more sophisticated than Eunice Foote’s, and he is rightly credited with establishing the experimental basis for the greenhouse effect, first suggested by Swiss physicist Horace Bénédict de Saussure in the 1760s <br />and later developed by French mathematician Joseph Fourier in the 1820s and French physicist Claude Pouillet in 1836...&quot; <br />1856 <br />&quot;....a paper entitled “Circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays,” by Eunice Foote. In two brisk pages, Foote’s paper anticipated the revolution in climate science <br />by experimentally demonstrating the effects of the sunlight on certain gases and theorizing how those gases would interact with Earth’s atmosphere for the first time. <br />In a column of the September 1856 issue of Scientific American titled “Scientific Ladies,” Foote is praised for supporting her opinions with “practical experiments.” <br />The writers noted: “this we are happy to say has been done by a lady.” <br />. <br />Foote’s research &amp; paper demonstrated the interactions of the sun’s rays on different gases through a SERIES of experiments....&quot; <br />((Variations of those fundamental Experiments are critiqued/taught in nearly every 1st-year science course on colleges and universities around the world.)) <br />1896 <br /> Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming. <br />1931 <br />&quot;Hulburt&#39;s own calculations supported Arrhenius&#39;s estimate that doubling or halving CO2 would bring something like a 4°C rise or fall of surface temperature, and thus &quot;the carbon dioxide theory of the ice ages... is a possible theory.&quot;(11) Hardly anyone noticed this paper. Hulburt was an obscure worker at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and he published in a journal, the Physical Review, that few meteorologists read.&quot; <br />1935 <br />Still, Science largely believed: &quot;Fifty times more carbon is dissolved in seawater than in the wispy atmosphere.&quot; &quot;Just like the Sea, plants would grow more lush and thus That would Control/Balance CO2 influence on Climate.?? <br />1948 <br />It was thought &quot;The self-regulating mechanisms of the carbon cycle can cope with the present influx of carbon of fossil origin.&quot; <br />The 1940s <br />&quot;...Callendar....concluded that over the past hundred years the concentration of the gas (CO2) had increased by about 10%. This rise, Callendar asserted, could explain the observed warming. <br />1952 <br />&quot;...Digital computers were now at hand for such calculations. The theoretical physicist Lewis D. Kaplan decided it was worth taking some time away from what seemed like more important matters to grind through extensive numerical computations. In 1952, he showed that in the upper atmosphere, adding more CO2 must change the balance of radiation....&quot; <br />1958 &amp; again in <br />1965 <br />AAAS and the president&#39;s Science Advisers presented Current Research &amp; Warning about centuries of Industrial Dumping of Toxic Waste Products into our atmosphere, leading <br />to threatening Climate Changes from Global Warming. <br />. <br />Broecker is probably best known for popularizing the term “global warming” through his 1975 paper <br />“Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” in which he predicted that emissions of carbon dioxide would raise global temperatures significantly in the 21st century. This is now seen as prophetic, but at the time, Dr. Broecker was an outlier. <br />Read more: <br /><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lady-scientist-helped-revolutionize-climate-science-didnt-get-credit-180961291/#KKvj73exVZHRQm7u.99">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lady-scientist-helped-revolutionize-climate-science-didnt-get-credit-180961291/#KKvj73exVZHRQm7u.99 </a><br />. <br /><a href="https://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm">https://history.aip.org/climate/co2.htm </a><br />. <br />CO2-----------&gt; proves the greenhouse effect <br /><a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2015/02/25/co2-greenhouse-effect-increase/">http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2015/02/25/co2-greenhouse-effect-increase/ </a><br />. <br />THERE <br />is <br />a line <br />of solid, <br />verified, <br />Multi-National <br />Replicated Empirical Evidence ! !

Only a complete idiot would believe that climate change is man made.<br />CO2 is not a greenhouse gas. Only 0.04% of the Earth&#39;s global atmosphere is CO2 and only 0.4% of that is man made.<br />75% of CO2 is released via our oceans. The warmer the oceans, the higher the release of CO2. <br />Climate influences the amount of CO2 , not the opposite.

Solutions: These 2 most important thing , heating in towns and electricity generation ordinary people can't solve. We have to push government to push those that provide our heating need and electricity to switch to 0% CO2 solutions. 1) Towns are heated today mostly with methane gas (CH4) ! We can transform this gas to hydrogen with steam reforming and send hydrogen in town instead of methane. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_reforming 2) electricity generation must be created from renewable sources much more like solar and wind. Also existing electricity power plant on fossil fuels methane and oil (coal plants should be banned ASAP) MUST install CO2 scrubbers on every chimney and store that CO2 underground (old oil field or old natural gas (methane) reservoirs). Every CO2 release on large scale should be banned and slowly those small to in the near future. 3) Transportation, On this individuals can have more effects. You can buy EV or use more public transportation and most importantly driving as less as possible. Use bicycle or electric bike or bicycle as much as you can. Those 3 things, 1, 2 are about 50-60% of CO2 emissions and 3 combined about 80% in total. Rest is meat consumption, plastics for example is less than 1% CO2 emissions. Also use less, reuse and do not buy so much things from far away that need huge amount of transportation. Buy local food, vegetables, fruits and always ask your self how much everything you do contribute to CO2 emissions . We can solve this right now but we have build infrastructure that depends on fossil fuels and it's not easy to switch instantaneously. Things for example like CO2 capture from air is solution that have no sense but it is promoted by fossil fuel industry. Firstly address all thing above and solve it to not emit CO2 in air, ONLY then we can talk about CO2 capture from air. Also thing like energy efficiency is very important. If you thermally insulate your home you will use less energy for heating and then emit less CO2. For example LED light use 10 times less electricity for same light intensity. Incandescent light is only 3-5% efficient and LED is up to 30% efficient. Heat pumps, seasonal heat storage, solar heated water, solar roof can save lot of CO2. Goodluck!

The young people I know have no context for the weather/climate they are experiencing because they don&#39;t know anything else. But the first forty years of my life were lived with stable climate and the past fifteen have not. The planet is heating up. As for natural forces, these forces were active fifty years ago and a hundred years ago and didn&#39;t cause the global heating that we are experiencing then. They aren&#39;t causing it now. I know that we&#39;ve become addicted to comfort and convenience and we don&#39;t like change, but that seems like a sorry excuse to destroy the world we live in.

If you want to convince me, graphs with no units of measurement, or with truncated y axes aren&#39;t gonna cut it.  Have you published anything in a peer-reviewed journal yet? <br /><br />And that bit about snow cover near the end looks pretty dodgy. Spring snow cover is the accepted standard for measuring snow loss. If, as this lecturer claims, fall and winter show more snow cover (though not more volume of snow), yet it&#39;s gone earlier, that&#39;s pretty strong support for the idea that the earth is warmer than before. Also, since snow reflects more sunlight back into space than does land or open water, the earlier decrease in snow cover increases the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth, and in turn, surface temperatures. In step with earlier dates of spring budburst for many plant species, reduced spring snow cover is a sign that winter conditions are lasting for a shorter period while growing seasons are getting longer.

Second, did you miss how the record cold/wet spring in parts of the US has crops WAY late? Third, in the rest of the series you hear from other professors, see more of the now 1000+ papers ignored by the IPCC until the next update - that'll be fun. Fourth, Princeton, Yale and a slew of others are finally realizing the low cloud control over the planet... it is 30% driven by cosmic rays, and about 10% by solar particle forcing. Fifth, 59 straights months the average high temps are not breaking records, its how cool it gets at night... is that so damn scary? Note: this is not disputed. Sixth, extreme temp days are down... err, just on the high side. When I grew up in Pittsburgh there would be a week of 100 degree days every year... they've had about 10 in 12 years now. This pattern is EVERYWHERE.... its just that its not getting so cold at night. Seventh, if you watched the rest of the series you would know that earth has two modes.... one where we look. the ice at the poles and the mid-latitudes get very temperature, and the other where we desalinate, and spread the cold water and ice cubes into the sea, only to have it happen again and again ever spring because you can't not-freeze the poles in their 6month winter. Eighth, After the models said the opposite, all real-world aberrations of phytoplankton and chlorophyl show amazing growth in size and number... which kills 25% of the ocean threat argument in itself. Nineth, When an atom bomb shows you how much energy is in one tiny piece of matter, how could anyone espouse we ignore all particle forcing in favor of a subset of energy waves? Solar scientists have pleaded, the IPCC finally agreed.... you are all just scared of what is about to happen. Princeton, Yale, Stanford, Berkeley, Israel, India, China, Japan... all their scientists see it... so do we. PS- we also forecast the failure of all dark matter searches in 2011. All $4B worth of them. Our student is Faris Wald, google him and 'national champion'. Our papers, mentioned in #1, are being used in a satellite mission (Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite) and a team from ETH Zurich and NASA. Next.

UgwiqBRX0Myb5EjOnMZ4AaABAg	1	0	2019-06-27 09:24:04	Rob Bishop	I hear your assertions, but don’t see the background data to support them. <br /><br /><br /><br />I’m questioning if the electric energy input is really comparable to the thermal radiation from the sun?<br /><br /><br />At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYoOcaqCzxo&amp;t=32m00s">32:00</a> in the video there are equations for electrical power entering the atmosphere, and I think they’re missing some symbols. I think when you show atmospheric resistance at “200 x 1015 ohm m2” it means 200 x 10^15 ohm/m2, and “GEC current = 10-12 Amps/ m2” means 10^-12 Amp/m2. Because 10 amps/sq.m. is a lot and would be readily noticed.<br /><br /><br />Also, 10^-12 Amp/m2 is what you get when you divide 200 kV by 200 x 10^15 ohms/m2 (I = V/R). <br /><br /><br /><br />10^-12 Amp/m2 seems like a very small amount. Multiplied by 300 kV (P = I x V) is only 10^-7 W/m2. Compared to the 1,300 W/m2 of solar thermal radiant input?<br /><br /><br />At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYoOcaqCzxo&amp;t=28m40s">28:40</a> you say that with the new model, when electrical effects are considered “the effects of CO2 go to zero instantly”. Where is this documented? <br /><br /><br /><br />I’m keeping an open mind, but am not convinced.	UCy1CBhRkNvyeIQCjAIl3PRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1CBhRkNvyeIQCjAIl3PRw	0

So if for example the total x-ray intensity jumps 10,000 times from. 0. 00001W to 0.1W, who cares? in. the context of TSI in the range of 1360W, would be virtually irrelevant. So, what is the total magnitude of the increase he is claiming is so important but ignored by climatologists?

Speed of stirring, length of stirring both area and duration, all impact the pots content. Maybe too simple an example, but each of these ignored factors is in fact the difference between a Great meal and a ruined disaster. If the physics and natural laws of existence are in fact constant, Micro to Macro what &quot;stirring of the pot,&quot; actually does makes less sense to ignore.<br /><br /><br />Sorry Silly laymen here.

The entire premise of the first 12 minutes of this talk is wrong, based on the speakers <i>misreading</i> of this most basic unit of measurement. He says it does not include long wavelength radiation! To top that, he includes graphs from the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment site from the University of Colorado Boulder where they clearly label the graphs in the spectral coverage column as &quot;all&quot;. Look up the definition of TSI anywhere...NASA, Wikipedia, etc,...---&quot;Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) is a measure of the solar power over <i>all wavelengths</i> per unit area&quot;. The staggering incompetence of this cannot be overstated. How can this pass? His whole argument is completely bogus and he actually bolsters the real climate scientific conclusion of GHG global warming.

Also those X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves _do_ reach the stratosphere. This is directly observed and well known atmospheric science. Also, to claim that radiation "goes down through the global electric current" is silly, as an electric current is an _electric charge flow_ and radiation is *_not electrically charged_* . It is impossible for photons to comprise and electric current or to be affected by magnetic fields. So instead of admitting that you misunderstood what TSI is you made up a claim that goes against physics and atmospheric science....directly observable science. You are compounding your false claim with others. Why would you do this? You need to put a disclaimer at the bottom of the video saying that the first 12 minutes are incorrect. Please be honest.

The entire spectrum of electromagnetic radiation does reach the atmosphere and is read by the satellites measuring TSI shown on those charts. Only charged particles are deflected by the magnetosphere. You have confused the Total Irradiance Monitor (measures TSI - the _entire spectrum_ ) with the Spectral Irradiance Monitor which measures only visible, near infrared, and UV. Anybody can look this stuff up. Why don't you just admit it, _you got it wrong._ Being sloppy is one thing, but to deny it when proven wrong is worse. Do you care about being true?..factual? Are you telling me that "radio waves, microwaves, infrared or x-rays" do not reach the upper atmosphere 645 km up, where the satellite is taking these measurements with a device specifically designed to measure the entire spectrum?? The video says at 4:03 "This is the total solar irradiance. it's based on a wide variety of different wavelength in the ultraviolet and picking up into the extreme ultraviolet range. It does not touch radio waves, microwaves, infrared or x-ray solar flares." *_NO, FALSE, INCORRECT, ERROR_* The TIM on the SOURCE satellite (for instance) measures _the entire electromagnetic spectrum._ You cannot deny this fact and anyone can research this and see you are wrong.

Cosmic rays, energetic particles from space of all levels, UV variances, etc. are all studied extensively, modeled and included in climate science, IPCC , and CMIP modeling. <a href="http://solarisheppa.geomar.de/">http://solarisheppa.geomar.de/</a> <a href="http://solarisheppa.geomar.de/cmip6">http://solarisheppa.geomar.de/cmip6</a> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also in the description to say &quot;STOP PRETENDING CLIMATE CHANGE BEGAN IN 1850, THERE IS ROBUST DATA GOING WELL INTO THE PAST.&quot; is a very dishonest statement, a disinformation tactic, and also a straw man fallacy. No climate scientist &quot;pretends&quot; this or would claim such an absurdity. The entire climate history is being studied. While climate always is changing-, the sudden introduction of a major climate forcing factor such as CO2 (and methane) has caused a dramatic accelerating change to the thermodynamic energy budget of the Earth-sun system causing this sudden dramatic accelerating warming we are now witnessing.

This is a fact, not even my opponents in climate change deny this. You re bafflingly off the mark. The change of a few parts per billion? When we've lost 20% of earth's magnetic field?

CME can destroy electrical equipment. <br /><br />Also Sun spots cycles are used by those promoting astro meteorolgy which is unacceptable to the emerging bureaus of meteorology because of it observational nature. At that time it could not be proven in mathematics and due to popular overuse of natal chart astrology in unscientific profit/guru driven goals manner. still hard to do it today but govt bodies are 90% there. People like Inigo Jones used both and he was ridiculed in a conference in Canberra by a Jealous New Zealand scientist and only OZ farmers like my Uncle believed. He told me when I worked out Brukner Cycles from studies in OZ rainfall. <br /><br />The other thing is it was possibly political a particular scientist purchased I think 1100 hundred copies of Total Vertical Column Modulation paper and distributed it to friends. The author was flabbergasted and had to accept Foster is the king.... He could study sunspots and predict weather patterns for two weeks Foster could do it for for 4 weeks. The copy right of the works is owned by the publisher called David Burton Inigo Jones weather forecaster on Facebook. Foster is the author. Foster has knowledge of how this works. Only David Burton has rights to sell this book. David uses his knowledge to speculate on wheat and cotton futures. here sis a group who have been using this information to control global stock markets. William Delbert Gann (possibly stone mason type order) seems to have something to do with teaching David Burton for the cost of a house what he knew. I can explain most of what you are saying. thankyou yours is the science to all my crazy ideas...<br /><br />So a secret group of business leaders used private and public resources to fund private interest research and allowed mainstream science to continue on as normal. Society had turned it&#39;s back on that but to get a copy of Fosters book you have always had to go through those people and that cost you a house for the course....

Cloud seeding has about 4% efficiency, which is enough to take out hailstorms and reduce flooding. SRM has about a 0.1% effect. Ionospheric manipulation is easy, but the downward effect is small - only ~0.0004%. If you spray SRM (oxidized metals - insulators) it takes ionospheric manipulation to 0 because insulators destroy conductivity. Some other things you hear about are plain fake and made up. Evaporators and cloud machines are total garbage, as are the laser nonsense stories.

UgxFEzXH0d3YN_xkfjJ4AaABAg	1	0	2019-04-27 15:31:34	MrBrianDuga	So a question I have is: Scientist Lonnie Thompson is known for drilling ice core samples in equator belt mountains which today, much do not have any ice left (or very little). His focus was on that &quot;hockey stick curve&quot; where CO2 levels have risen in a natural cycle. Each time, the correction event - an ice age would reset the levels. Ice would reflect more of the sun&#39;s energy into space and/or a massive volcanic eruption would have tipped the scale. His latest ice core data (in our century) showed the CO2 levels rising faster and higher (than previous curves have reached) and would seam to predict our next correction event (a new ice age). Maybe the earth&#39;s crust warms enough to cause shifting in tectonic plates and/or a massive eruption. So THAT data isn&#39;t enough to raise urgency around the risk of a catastrophic tipping point? What does all this variability you mention matter if we&#39;re still scratching our heads over a workable model well beyond when it&#39;s too late to act? I agree there&#39;s a conflict of interest possible - pretty much anywhere there&#39;s an industry that pops up a special interest is born. It&#39;s a side-effect of capitalism. But in this case I wonder if it&#39;s a distraction to mention it. Especially when there&#39;s things we can actually do right now to improve the outlook (saving echo systems, endangered species, perhaps human lives).

We are in an ice age sind over a million years, we are on a peak of the Milankovich Cycle, so yes: Your "Ice age" will come. https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&channel=trow&biw=1920&bih=1005&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=f2HJXMb2O-GgrgTLi7CADg&q=atmosphere+history&oq=atmosphere+history&gs_l=img.3..0i5i30l4j0i8i30l2.2186.5081..6682...0.0..0.55.384.8......1....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i67j0j0i30.Hz07Wj78NgI#imgrc=zeYlYZ5K6W2eoM: But it will take very long for a human life perspective.

Below are some linked articles that most viewers have never encountered, or which are rejected off-hand, by the vast majority of the earth&#39;s still rapidly growing human population of 7.7 billion people.<br /><br />Most humans feel quite separate from all the other millions of species of life, including our closest animal cousins. Human hubris prevents most people from accepting the concept that there may be things we can&#39;t engineer our way out of. It is also hard for many to accept the concept that we may have long ago passed a threshold beyond which we we could turn things around.

If you think it is more do your math to prove it. Remember, present summer highest temperatures in my country are about 5 °C higher then when I was kid before 50 years and lasts for more then month (sometimes two months) while it was 10 days at max in that time. And usual winter temperatures are 10 °C higher. Do your math to show me that it is of solar activity which goes up in that way in past 50 years.<br />Might be that, might be this is not science which I would adopt. I understand that universe, sun and solar system must be electrical in nature but calculate and show me what changed in past 50 years in that level, which doesn&#39;t happen for thousand of years of chronicles in my City.

I am not sure where this talk leaves the possibility of cooling down to a mini ice age and maybe heating at the same time (i.e., heating up, I&#39;ve read about our galaxy passing through an area of the cosmos that is heating up ALL the planets in our solar system). I found a neat practical site - The Ice Age Farmer. Also some NASA reports of glaciers starting to grow, one document from 2015 re: Antarctic and one in Greenland since 2018. Bottom line is, we&#39;ve now engineered so much toxicity into agriculture, the skies, the water and medicines that coming out of an age of toxicity I completely agree is priority.

Ugw3YW5eHtsoUBZu2s54AaABAg	0	0	2019-04-08 20:06:00	Rich Buckley	Does anyone ever actually look at the science and bigger picture? <br /> <br />Atmospheric Science coming out of our National Labs treats our Sun as an invariable. The Sun is the main driver of Climate Change. Our Sun is not an invariable. <br /> <br />MINORITY OPINION REPORT <br /> <br />As a member of Citizens&#39; Climate Lobby (CCL) I continue to do independent climate research. CCL focuses on shortsighted CO2 levels in our atmosphere. CO2 data, reviewed through CCL&#39;s political lens for shortened time frame, creates the wrong conclusions, and is leading CCL lock-step in the wrong direction. We must prepare for a rapid onset of an ice-age instead. Global Warming appears to be a temporary luxury. The current CCL lobby stance position is based on false science. Clean Air must regain its original understanding. Clean air is breathable atmospheric gas levels that support human life and lush biologic diversity. Clean air does not require the removal of CO2. CO2 is insignificant in global warming! The earth has cycled through much higher levels of CO2 many times before, providing lush living environments through a beneficial heating cycle tempered by 10,000-year ocean memory, in temperature ranges in which humans and biodiversity thrive. More than being shortsighted in their focus CCL members default in being persuaded in scientific matters ONLY by &quot;consensus opinion politics.&quot; We are facing another ice-age occurrence that is far more important to prepare for than global warming. Research into the actual long term scientific data, shows Carbon Dividend Tax is based on false science. <br /> <br />WHAT REALLY MATTERS <br /> <br />What science is there to support the prediction of a rapid onset of another ice age? <br /> <br />THE SCIENCE: LOOK AT OUR SUN&#39;S PLASMA FIELD <br /> <br />The significance of David LaPoint&#39;s 3 videos <a href="https://youtu.be/9EPlyiW-xGI">https://youtu.be/9EPlyiW-xGI</a> when combined with Rolf Witzsche&#39;s follow-on reporting (see link below) illustrates a strong scientifically based hypothesis by Witzsche and well cited each step of the way with long term, ice-core drillings covering ice samples over many tens of thousands of years. These long term charts clearly demonstrate climate change is tracking to an ice-age and that ice-age onset can occur in one day (a change that seems to also be supported by still frozen animals with undigested food found emerging from thawing tundra, and additionally supported by ice core samples showing very rapid changes in atmospheric temperatures.) <br /> <br />RAPID COOLING LINKED TO SUN&#39;S PLASMA FIELD <br /> <br />This RAPID COOLING phenomenon occurs when there is insufficient electric current about our Sun, to sustain the Sun&#39;s plasma field. These magnetic plasma fields (“Primer Fields” named by David LaPoint in the above referenced videos) turn on and off instantly, and not over long periods of time. The Sun has many different intensity of cycles. The Sun is mistakenly considered an invariable in today&#39;s politicized, public atmospheric false-science. The sun is not an invariable. <br /><a href="https://youtu.be/9s63WUwwTVc">https://youtu.be/9s63WUwwTVc</a> <br /> <br />Unless our Atmospheric Science Department at LLNL, the current politicized wing of the Deep State input to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, can be de-politicized, they should be closed down. There is too much they have to account for to the public as a declassified agency, and can not be trusted, they act to support with bias, Deep State interests first and foremost, seeing themselves as neutral, while never daring to speak truth to power; they speak only what serves power. <br /> <br />We should put our resources instead into clean air and clean water science, on an encompassing solar system wide and galactic-level research, not carbon taxation driven by politicized false atmospheric science. There is far more going on that we need to first understand.	UCzfETvx7Sa9LfrSoG5xexFQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzfETvx7Sa9LfrSoG5xexFQ	0

UgxEUxblrcSQd0Sk0FN4AaABAg	1	2	2019-04-03 15:04:18	Frank Hensler	Mitigation of the climate change issues requires an understanding of what is actually causing the problems.<br /><br />Looking at the past research according to the cambridge study about &quot;pole reversal&quot; shows that when the planet experiences a poll reversal it is followed by planetary wide &quot;oxygen crisis&quot; and &quot;carbon dioxide crisis&quot; that flip flop until an equilibrium can be reached.<br /><br />There are currently events occuring that will exacerbate this condition .. and the fact is that human interaction is not capable of an even of this magnatude..and has very little to do with it.<br /><br />The earth has a insulating blanket of atmosphere around it that is protected by the planetary magnetic field. The distance this blanket extends out in to space is &quot;karman line&quot;. Over the past 20 years the earth has lost 12 km of our karman line. That&#39;s 12km of our atmosphere.<br /><br />A logical hypothesis would be that if someone were to calculate the amount of water created by combustion of 12km of hydrogen and oxygen; and then add that water to the volume of our oceans...you would find it would account for the small amount of ocean rise around the planet..<br /><br />However it has a much greater effect when you realize that by raising the volume of fresh water in the ocean you lower its overall salinity.<br /><br />Coupled with the fact that now the insulating blanket around the planet is much thinner and therefore the polar icecaps begin to melt. Which lowers the over all ocean salinity even more.<br /><br />The magnetic shield protecting our atmosphere is depandant on the surface of our planet being able to conduct electricity.<br />Known as tilluric current it must be able to travel across the entire surface of our planet which includes the oceans.<br /><br />And as pure water by its self does not have the ability to conduct electricity. The salt in the oceans provides what&#39;s needed to support the tilluric cureent ion exchange which in turn supports the strength of our magnetic shield..<br /><br />If the salinity of our oceans falls below the point where it can conduct the needed current to support our magnetic shield; the the shield will collapse....<br /><br />At which point the high energy plasma from the sun will convert/ combust the remaining hydrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere to water<br /><br />This supports the findings of the cambridge study in relation to the relitive oxygen and carbon dioxide crisises described in conjunction with the &quot;pole reversal&quot; <br /><br />Re-establishing the karmon line by adding the oxygen and hydrogen back to our atmosphere will circumvent the entire process..<br /><br />And with the somewhat recient discovery that &quot;high energy radio waves&quot; can convert water in bulk to hydrogen and oxygen means that the fix to all of these issues we are technically capable of performing.<br /><br />The issue is they need to be start ASAP because there is no telling exactly how much time we have left....as the sun could sneeze tomorrow and we could be in a world of hurt..<br /><br />Plus to truly figure out what the carbon offset actually is you MUST take in to consideration the related loss of oxygen involved with a reduction of our atmosphere by 12km....is why it looks like carbon dioxide level are skyrocketing...<br />(So everything that has been published are false readings if they don&#39;t account for the relative oxygen loss also.)<br /><br />Thank you so much for even responding...<br />I can&#39;t tell you how many people ive tried to talk too about this.<br />They either &quot;dont engage&quot; or &quot;someone comes on blasting me&quot; like i dont know what im talking about..<br />And they start sending me links to articles where every scientist who wrote them believes incorrectly that the shield around our planet geta its power from the &quot;dynamo&quot; in our planet. <br /><br />They think that the earths molten core spinning differently than the planet around it generates electricity but it does not...and because of a very simple reason..<br /><br />If you float a tinnis ball in a bowl of water <br />- (picturing the ball as the core of our planet)<br />- and then beging to spin the bowl; <br />- which in turn spins the water <br />- you will note that at first the ball is not spinning <br />- but it begins too and then accelerates<br />- untill it matches the speed you are spinning thw bowl at<br /><br />It means that the energy used to produce the magnetic shield around our planet does not come from our planet at all.<br /><br />In fact it is powered by the.electrons in the high energy plasma from the sun.<br />(Which means the higher the output from the sun-the stronger our shield gets)<br />And right now we are in a solar minimum - which means we are at risk.<br /><br />I will post this information in the comments of your video like you asked..<br />But if you could use your influence to place this into someones hands who can take some kind of action...<br />I would really appreciate it..<br /><br />Ive sent measages to the white house, to NOWAA, and to various collages..<br />I just cant seem to get anyone to give it some serious consideration.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Frank Hensler<br /><br />PS... If you incounter the same type of resistance i have...<br />I would be perfectly willing to take on any scientist who says that this information is incorrect.<br />I am perfectly capable of defending and demonstrating what ive said here with a high level of common sense that they will look like fools for even challenging you. (Like floating the tennis ball)<br /><br />And again <br />thank you for anything you do about this.<br />everyone on this planet is a stakeholder <br />So Everyone has the right to be heard.<br />And this conversation has no place for ego&#39;s <br />If they actually Intend to make a difference in the outcome.

Stephen Hawking Tipping point The Cambridge physicist regarded global warming as one of the biggest threats to life on the planet. The physicist was particularly fearful of a so-called tipping point, where global warming would become irreversible. He also expressed concern about America's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement. "We are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250 degrees, and raining sulphuric acid," he told BBC News. . http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png . http://www.oocities.org/marie.mitchell@rogers.com/climate_files/1800YearGlobalTemperature.jpg	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UgwEUbTzRLMYfQc9JUt4AaABAg	Metcraft

As to the posters comment (1) or you could also say, how about including escaping methane in the models as it is such a potent greenhouse gas - or you could include aviation and shipping, which currently it ( the ipcc) doesn&#39;t. Or even the use of non-existent technology when calculating carbon budgets (2) what are you talking about, &quot;showing only spring snow cover&quot;(3) this is completely erroneous, the 1850 date is the new 1750 date, i.e. when the use of coal really got started. That robust data is nothing of the sort, but it isn&#39;t excluded. What on earth makes you believe the past is ignored? There are reams of papers that use many proxies, and i expect the ice cores are ignored too?<br /><br /><br />You seem to think you are explaining something in laymans terms, when in fact you are a layman. You stumble around, &#39;discovering&#39; things, and in your own way make sense of it all. <br />You do realise that the people that actually work on a field that covers your theories probably knew more about this before they took their doctoral thesis than you ever will.

Maybe it's atmospheric pressure to blame for Venus's "greenhouse" problem and not the compounds that make up that atmosphere? Why is Mercury's dark-side cold, why is Venus's dark-side hot, sure there's a difference between tidal-locked Mercury and Venus, but if Earth had a 117 solar day with a 243 day rotation, that dark side would get pretty damn cold.

Because that is when we actually started to record the temperature of the globe.<br />There are no direct temperature measurments prceeding 1850. Climate models require empirical evidence. The potential errors from derived paleoclimate data means that any modelling done using paleoclimate data will have an increased factor of error. Far from perfect, but there are reasons certain data is not included for some modelling. I have not doubt that some clever scientists have inclded paleoclimate data into climate models, but the levels of error would have made the modelling redundant. <br /><br />Just looking at the variance of TCI collected since the 1960&#39;s I can&#39;t see how solar forcing would has as much impact as this guy claims.<br />At the beginning of the clip he tries to overplay the effect of volacanic activity in climate change compared to anthropgenic influences. Volacano&#39;s make up less than 10% of the anthropogenic inputs into our atmosphere yearly. <br /><br />It is an intersting theory.

Manmade carbon dioxide is responsible for 0.117% of the total warming caused by the atmospheric greenhouse effect and is therefore unmeasurable. The tragic situation is that the public and their elected leaders simply do not understand these elementary concepts of science and allow the charade of AGWW/climate change to continue at a worldwide annual expense of over $2 trillion dollars. AGW/climate change is a deception and fraud designed for three purposes. Firstly the unification of a socialist one world government under direction of the UN which will force massive population reductions through the restrictions of inexpensive abundant energy. Secondly unscrupulous business people were allowed to develop the carbon cap trading scheme (scam) to the enrichment of corporate institutions and individuals with the complacent help of the U.S. government; i.e., the false assertion by the EPA that carbon dioxide is a pollutant and the US Supreme Court’s ruling that the EPA can enforce such nonsense. Certainly there will be RICO lawsuits in the near future and people will go to jail over the fraud. Perhaps even SEC lawsuits. It is noted that Al Gore&#39;s venture capital company was an initial investor in Nest Labs $30 million development stage financing and which was later sold to Google for $3.2 billion dollars as a late stage startup. At the time certain government departments were being lobbied to force all new homes in America to include carbon dioxide monitors which the Nest thermostat could do. This also included all homes financed by government lending institutions. Thirdly, the Big Green Energy Scheme (scam) is being subsidized by taxpayers the world over to produce unworkable power and energy systems. Solar and wind for baseload power are prime examples. Once the public becomes aware of the AGW/climate change deception and fraud there will be massive class action lawsuits for redress of grievances and the recovery of funds. Support President Trump&#39;s recent decision to form his Presidential Commission on Climate Security to challenge the deep state science institutions in the US and the IPCC. The sooner this deception and associated waste is put to an end the sooner monies can be more properly invested in the research and design of workable high energy flux density energy generation.

I mean, people are actually devising plans for how to stop the ice caps from melting. That&#39;s the single most absurd thing I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. We have drought and famine around the world and people are fighting to keep the majority of the planet&#39;s fresh water locked up in the polar ice. They act as if the ice caps were vital to the survival of every living creature. Nothing eats ice.	UC-4v41Oyh5jDkKGXaNft3Ew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-4v41Oyh5jDkKGXaNft3Ew	0

UgzXzrQ5_V0JrmSwe094AaABAg	1	0	2019-03-21 01:06:02	Kathie Gifford	Where did the 97% consensus that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23globalwarming">#globalwarming</a> is real come from. This doesn&#39;t give a definitive answer but does show several studies/surveys that were made. I&#39;m concerned because it doesn&#39;t seem there&#39;s agreement on who is &#39;qualified&#39; to have an opinion. Are the only &#39;valid&#39; opinions the ones that agree humans are causing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23climatechange">#climatechange</a>?<br /><br /><br />Abstract <br />The consensus that humans are causing recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23globalwarming">#globalwarming</a> is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming (&#39;no position&#39;) represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002</a>	UCXOpljBJS9nnkyidegYIjqw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXOpljBJS9nnkyidegYIjqw	0

UgyldfT6BvRNfGm_-n94AaABAg.8s_S5blzKRn8sg7ZOqBPcq		2	2019-03-20 02:08:45	Emerson Harris	​@Charlton Blake Lithium ion, very toxic and there are regulations on how you need to dispose of them, however they are not always followed. Outside the US and EU those regulations just don't exist. Can they be disposed of properly? Yes, if the effort is made to do so that is. As for the salt water and others bulk storage batteries I mentioned, they are much less toxic. The salt water ones are actually designed to use more common elements like water, salt, carbon and silicon. All stuff that is very non-toxic and found all over the globe. There is also other ways to store energy. For example if there is a big hill you can pump water up it when during the day then at night run it though a generator. In fact things like that are much more cost effective in energy storage. There are even options around pressurized air, molten salts, and converting water to hydrogen and oxygen to be drive a generator at a later time. They all have risks of course. Personally, I would rather aim to next gen nuclear options. Thorium "walk away safe" design reactors, the uranium 10 year slow burn plug, and others. The LIFTER reactor designs from the 70s have serious issues in cost to build and tragic events like 3 Mile Island, Fukashima, and Chernobyl still in the public mind. But all those events are preventable with better designs, in fact all the reactors I just mentioned can NOT meltdown by design. The laws of physics prevent it. Some of the next gen designs even can use the waste of current reactors as fuel and the waste they produce is like 1/10th the amount and it is radioactive for like 500 years (compared to 1 to 3 million like current reactors). Of course all those that are screaming about climate change the hardest also say no nuclear, even though it has 0 co2 emissions that they should love and it is the only power technology that could actually replace coal and natural gas... the lack of logic they have confuses me.

Lithium ion (the more portable ones in your phones and laptops) ya they are very toxic. There are more bulky batteries that are for bulk storage that have a lot more common elements in it that are much safer. There is even a new type that is based mainly on salt water, granted these bulk less toxic batteries will never be in your phone or laptop as they are very heavy.

Although I&#39;d add that our fossil fuels are a finite resource, and it makes sense to &quot;take it easy&quot; on using them up. Specifically, to modulate usage somewhat down in advance of the potential for shortages. It&#39;s for this reason that I typically don&#39;t argue TOO much with global warming devotees, because I can see that they are unwittingly providing a potential upside, in spite of having horribly broken scientific support. But then I do go back and argue with them when they propose ideas that they feel are &quot;green&quot; but actually use up more resources.

All four of these have been illustrated to be frauds. At a high level perspective, any time you hear that 97% of anything is some consensus, the needle on your bullshit detection meter should be pegged.

My reference to the 97% is with respect to the spurious "97% of scientists consensus" nonsense: Oreskes, 2004 - the flawed climate abstracts survey Doran and Zimmerman, 2009 - the spurious 2-question online non-scientific survey Anderegg, 2010 - Google Scholar filtration on citations of articles supporting tenets of ACC in context of resume padding Cook et al, 2013 - abstract counting exercise of a subjective and dubious nature ... quickly debunked. The problem here is that all four of those studies had little to do with science and even less to do with the objectivity of mathematics. They were politically motivated, subjectively conducted and had a preordained outcome. More to the point, these studies bear little in common with your thesis, which, as I understand it, has been posited for nearly thirty years -- "it's the sun, stupid." Look, I am not trying to be an asshole -- my friends tell me that I've already got that base covered. What we have here in terms of “Climate Change as Advertised” is a massive government orchestrated fraud. Although you and I may be targeting the same point, we are doing so from different perspectives. A poly-dimensional high-resolution mind is always a good thing. Cheers.

Natural variability not a thing, it is the result of many processes and interactions, some of which are well understood, some are the subject of research and some are not yet known. . Complex systems and emergent properties are really difficult or even impossibleto predict. Even simple systems can be intractable ( like the three body problem). However the global situation is clear. We measure the total energy input from the sun and the total outgoing energy.<br />This talk is complete waffle.

Check temperatures for earth's history. 1988 is a terrible place to start- it's what the 64 BiLLION dollar green industry and the ego-maniacal, govt funded scientists want you to see. This thing is MUCH bigger than we know. And we're far from 2000ppm. When people start telling you that the floods and cold is because of C02 as well, check the fact that cold air can't hold much moisture so, when it gets colder.. it rains, a lot. Check the history of rainfall and floods in Nebraska from the 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and on and on. Illinois.. same thing- including the "flood of the century" in 1979. Also, listen to Dr. Moore talk about the fact that ocean life began growing outer crusts to protect themselves and used up a ton of C02 in the process. They are part of what make up the dead plant and animal life that creates our fossil fuels. Anyway, just get the govt OUT of my life and the free market will take care of what we need. And somehow, we have GOT to get scientists who are too afraid to say anything for fear of their lives being ruined by de-funding and the being ostracized by the unholy "elite" scientific/journalist alliance. Also, are you aware of the hoaxes played on the "elite" scientific community? These morons PUBLISHED as "peer reviewed" science, in science journals, complete garbage that 3 people, who know the corruption, wrote. Activist scientists and "journalists" are "reviewing" papers and making proclamations to benefit themselves and insure those govt grants keep flowing in. I really loathe living in a world governed and lead by such corruption. I will watch and listen and see.. what I'm seeing so far is much colder temps each year in the winter and either lower or shorter duration hot temps in the summer. Weather and Climate are BIG BIG systems and we have very little effect on them. GO GREED INDUSTRY! Just don't lie and do the right thing by the people since out government definitely won't.

It is colorless, odor less , plays a very small role in Green House effect compared to water vapor, methane and others. We exhale it with every breath. In addition it is needed for plants to flourish. I have read the earth must have at least 280 ppm for plants to exist ( us to exist). We are at 400 ppm now. From ice cores we know CO2 concentration has been as high as 4000 ppm in the past. Currently the percent by volume of CO2 in the atmosphere is .036%.

A growing world population, shortage of fresh water and the pollution of it and the general environment. If it were man made we, the population on earth, would be the biggest variable in the equation. Sustainable economic policy would still be overridden by population growth. So how do wo tackle our problems if the global warming trend continues for hundreds of years to come? How will mankind cope with the inevitable? Imho we must not reduce CO2 as it is the food for the plants that provide us with food and the air that we breathe, but we will need to find a way to curb population growth in the mid- to longterm. After all it is us that consume and pollute our very planet we need to live on. We need to get past the stage of explaining and denial and come up with sensible means of protecting against the inevitable. Now that we know the problem is not man made it won&#39;t change a thing by all of us becoming vegan. Sustainable energy and mobility is a good thing though, because we need the fossil resources like oil for more precious uses rather than burning them as fuel. So reducing plastic for one way usage is a good thing to cope with pollution of the seas. I really think mankind is smart enough to solve its problems. Abstaining from meat is not part of the solution. As we know by now the brain evolved because of meat consumption. So does eating no more meat mean mankind will become dumber again? But maybe that study finding was wrong as well as is the theory of climate change being man made ;)	UCKuXdJMF8R_9ZIQP71MEfsA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKuXdJMF8R_9ZIQP71MEfsA	0

The main &quot;blame&quot; on humans to my knowledge is the extremely rapid C02 rise and its correlation with temperature due to the far simpler space weather concept that energy comes in from the sun and the earth radiates it away in the form of infra red unless a greenhouse gas absorbs this infra red and converts the energy into kinetic warming the atmosphere...<br /><br /><br />Does this video deny that concept? because surely thats more important than misrepresentation of UV data during a mass ejection given that this C02 thing will have a CUMULATIVE effect. A few thousand years ago C02 was 200ppm, a few hundred years ago it was 250ppm, pre-industrial revolution it reached what like 275? 10 years later its at 300ppm and last I checked its well over 400ppm. it changed more in my lifetime than in a thousand years and there&#39;s no sign of it slowing down.<br /><br /><br />Pollution kills 6 million a year so you&#39;re right to be concerned about that also, but to suggest we dont have an impact on the climate is insane. we will see around a meter of sea level rise for every degree C increase exclusively due to the same ammount of water having a larger volume at higher temperatures... that&#39;s before considering ice melt. we know that sea levels were at least 9 meteres higher diring the precambrian age so we should expect nothing less if we trigger a runaway greenhouse effect. 9 meters floods a lot of cities. why do people feel the need to defend our wreckless ways, this is self preservation. the 6 million a year from pollution will look like nothing compared to climate catastrophe	UCNcScEQsOMMmFHX04dZdMdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNcScEQsOMMmFHX04dZdMdw	0

This statement given that CO2 is almost certainly not a driver of climate change seems correct. It is not, we are in a carbon minima and most plant species evolved during the last 6 million years when CO2 was 5000 ppmV some 10 times higher than today&#39;s level of 500 ppmV . Again the public has been misinformed by Science by consensus by modellers (courtesy of the IPCC and the media climate change hysteria) which are the Scientific equivalent of bookmakers! Data Scientists like myself were long disregarded in favour of gamblers and speculators (modellers) easily corrupted by the UN and the media. Thank you Al Gore for the inconvenient lie!

You believe that somehow human behaviour and industrialisation is causing the world to warm up. So how do you explain the medieval warm period, hardly any people and no industrialisation. How do you explain the mini ice age that followed in the 17th to 19th century when global population was increasing and wood and coal burning was everywhere. How do you explain the cooling period between 1940 to 1975 when industry was really going forward with no environmental controls?

UgxTMorm_Xc1MlRjisp4AaABAg	1	0	2019-03-12 02:15:46	Kenneth	Let agree with everything this video says about the science and look at the basis of the logic of this video:<br /><br />Climate Change = Natural variability + Human Change<br /><br />For sustainable living conditions for our civilisation, total climate change should be close to 0 or, in fact, negative if we want the climate to be more hospitable like how it was a few decades ago. Therefore, the necessary representation of the logic should be:<br /><br />0 (climate change)= Natural Variability + Human Change<br /><br />We all know that Human Change has been huge since industrial revolution, therefore we can say that:<br /><br />0 (climate change) = Natural Variability + huge surplus (human change)<br /><br />This video spends half an hour telling how natural variability is actually huge. So, now, we are left with:<br /><br />0 (climate change) = huge surplus (natural variability) + huge surplus (human changes) ???<br /><br />Obviously, it does not add up. We know we need climate change to be close to 0, and the only thing we can change is human change. Hence this video basically tells us that human change needs to be in huge deficits for the planet to be habitable. This is what the logic of this video promotes:<br /><br />0 (climate change) = hugely surplus (natural variability) + huge deficits (human change)<br /><br />Somehow, the speaker comes to an emotional notion that we shouldn&#39;t need to do anything about climate change, whilst everything he says before tells us we are in deeper climate problem than the science consensus tells us. Everyone in the crowd cheered for that!<br /><br />I will end with an analogy that every average folk can understand. A family of 4, a hardworking industrious man, a good caring housewife, a teenage boy and a newborn baby. The teenage boy found his new passion in rebellious rock and heavy metal and he exercises his freedom by playing his music out loud day and night. The baby finds it hard to sleep, becomes very difficult and is hindered in developments; the mother becomes very depressed, and; the father becomes a broken man seeing his beloved wife suffering and his family falling apart.<br /><br />If anyone, even experts, states that it is a natural post-maternity depression, even though there is an element of hormonal contribution, you would know that it is really the teenage boy&#39;s toxic behaviour.

Anyone who claims that climate science is a hoax, or is blatantly not man-made, and/or doesn&#39;t mention anything regarding Methane and its impacts as a result of human activity (particularly in the context of the Arctic and the Siberian Terrestrial Permafrost (Now PermaMelt), by definition, is either disingenuous, cherry picking data to support their own biases, or is grossly ignorant of the observational evidence of the Arctic Methane Bomb in the context of ensuring abrupt climate heating in the near-term due to self-reinforcing feedback loops. Most people are lazy and just focus on the &quot;IPCC consensus&quot; instead of exploring deeper analyses by fringe scientists (particularly biologists and ecologists), who provide a MUCH broader understanding of what the UNFILTERED climate science is really telling us. <br /><br />Ultimately, if you genuinely want to understand the climate science and the bigger picture implications, biologists and ecologists are the scientists to listen to. The overwhelming majority of scientists who make up the &quot;IPCC consensus&quot; are mostly physicists, who are not qualified to connect the dots regarding how all the man-made pollution, which creates all the greenhouse heating, invariably impacts the ongoing mass extinction of other species that we absolutely depend on for our survival, thereby having a snowball effect impacting habitat and the biosphere as a whole. Industrial agriculture practices and Animal agriculture also contribute massively to atmospheric imbalances of C02, Methane and other greenhouse gases, which tends to be continually ignored as a causal element, which is obviously MAN-MADE. I think the people who don&#39;t want to concede that greenhouse heating is man-made is a cop out from having to take responsibility for their actions.

Ugz1b27cNfQViYzsvBB4AaABAg	0	4	2019-03-11 17:32:06	John Doe	If CO2 would not cause any (measurable) global warming, and I am quite willing to consider this, that would necessarily jeopardize the greenhouse effect. If a natural concentration of 280ppm should warm the planet by about 8 to 10K, any substantial increase of CO2 (like the 410ppm we have now) will enhance that effect. And this I guess is the far more pressing question, which remains unanswered.<br /><br />So let me answer it. Well, we can all agree that emissivity of Earth&#39;s surface is not 1, but lower and henceforth the GHE has always been overstated. The dominant surface type is water which has a very high vertical emissivity of 0.987, which is usually quoted. However, what matters is the hemispheric emissivity and that is only 0.91, which reduces the GHE by about 35W/m2, or ~8K.<br /><br />Far more important is the great cloud &quot;trick&quot; in the GHE fairy tale. Via the albedo (~0.3) clouds massively reduce the absorptivity of Earth (surface) to only 0.7. Clouds are responsible for over 2/3 of that albedo. On the other side clouds get excluded from emissivity, as if they would not withhold LWIR. That is despite we all know the dominant impact clouds have on the rate of falling night time temperatures.<br /><br />In reality we can see that clouds are actually warming the planet. For instance weather data show, that temperatures are positively correlated with cloudiness. In other words, the more clouds, the warmer it is on average. This is perfectly consistent with all kinds of observations, and also in line with the basic concept of the GHE which is about effectively moving radiative emissions up to a higher level in the atmosphere, as explained in the video below. (Keep in mind that the mechanism Professor Merrifield explains will work much more effectively with clouds than with any GHG)<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUFOuoD3aHw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUFOuoD3aHw</a><br /><br />So we have a surface that will emit about 390*0.91 = 354W/m2. Over it we have clouds which reflect about 70W/m2 of solar radiation but withhold &gt;70W/m2 (80-100W/m2) of LWIR, which brings down total theoretic emissivity to somewhere between 255 to 275W/m2, or 0.65 to 0.7. That is excluding any thinkable GHGs. As a result we might a have a mild GHG induced GHE somewhere in the single digit range (0 to 9K), but definitely nothing like the 33K we are usually being told. And CO2 has, if any, only a negligible potential to warm the planet.	UCFFb2cSUBfMDTFP0C1A2J5w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFFb2cSUBfMDTFP0C1A2J5w	0

And for the record, you don't know what I understand. I do understand that correlation does not imply causation. That where there is causation the causative factor has to precede the related effect. And that CO2 changes lag behind temperature changes historically. Honestly, this should have been enough to destroy the AGW hypothesis in its infancy. There is no evidence that increased CO2 in the atmosphere causes temperature increases. The climate is such a complex chaotic system that laboratory experiments have zero ecological validity and computer models are all a complete waste of time and money. Another thing I know about science is that if you predict an outcome and that outcome doesn't happen then you're science is wrong. I also know that scientific theories are falsifiable. If you can explain literally any weather event, including normal weather, with "climate change" then it is as useful a scientific theory as Marx's communist manifesto is at explaining social issues, or Adlerian psychology at explaining all behaviours. That is to say, completely worthless. I also know that "deniers" give reasons for not believing. Alarmists just say worthless nonsense like "you don't understand science".

Since then ........... news blackout. I also wonder that if sea levels are reportedly rising, could that be in-part from measurements in selected geographical locations - centrifugal oceanic effect. Any science discussion on plate tectonic oscillation / subsidence that could affect sea level measurements making it appear that sea levels are rising ?

The Sun&#39;s luminosity decreased while global temperatures increased, the data is publicly available. If you think there&#39;s a global conspiracy, please be honest with yourselves; the people who have the most to gain are not climate scientists or indeed any scientists, they don&#39;t get paid that well. Governments make money from fuel duty, they lose it in subsidies to renewables. The renewables industry is a fraction of fossil fuels, do you really think they&#39;ve somehow managed to gain a greater influence despite less money and smaller size?

It would be like saying somone invented the term non-dairy and then pretending that non-dairy was a specific food group. 2) Facts do matter and what you wrote is not accurate. There is no such thing as 'the sun's lag effect', there can be a lag between changes in solar output and final result, but that's not what you're implying. If there is an increase in solar output, it takes time for the new higher temperature to be reached, but the temperature starts increasing immediately. 3) Continuing to sell oil is an $87.5T/year business - yes, that fact really matters. Climate science covers more than just global warming and the figure you cite covers university departments and whole slew of research, usually for non-profits, not the sort of thing that can really fund a CPAC. 4) No, climate concern lobbying is largely a populist movement, their main power comes from numbers of people, not numbers of $, it is why it is sadly less successful than it should be. Reducing subsidies on renewables and pulling back on carbon tax is a sign of their lack of political influence. Facts matter.

Even if you manage to shift the reasoning for why we need to reduce pollution, politicians and companies will find a way to exploit it for their own benefit (get ready for $300/lb vacuum grown beef).<br /><br />Our current survival model is way too dependent on living within a tiny window of favorable conditions. We need to work more on adaptability to living in any conditions. Then whether we have another ice age, have to go undergound, or even off planet, we&#39;ll be able to thrive.

If so at what point will these climate models based on increasing CO2 start to be inaccurate.<br /><br />Those who deny that pollutants are a cause, where they are prepared to make a prediction at all, have been forecasting a counterbalancing fall in global temperatures for at least the past 15 years yet, inconveniently, global temperatures continue in an upward trajectory (albeit with natural variations year to year).<br /><br />Given that the maths is not wrong is the tenet of this that the sun will continue to drive increasing temperatures on and on through the 21st Century and switching to renewables will not have any impact on this?<br /><br />The inconvenient truth for deniers continues to be the temperature rises.

And so far these predictions are playing out. If you have an alternative hypothesis based on prioritising different data then do you contradict the models that forecast a continuing increase in global temperatures or not and if so to what extent or do you have an alternative ‘model’? Do you have any predictive timescale for the sun “to go to sleep”? Are you anticipating a time scale in months, years or decades?

Many species died out for many different reasons. SUV's were not to blame and neither were coal plants. The Sahara desert fertilizes the Amazon every year, with the biological material left over from Lake Chad. How did people cause all of these million years of mayhem? Was the entire earth always green? If so, who caused the desertification before we got here? It's postulated that an Asteroid killed off the creatures from the Cretaceous and the Jurassic by freezing the plants and starving them to death. Again, not people. Maybe I"m an ignorant idiot, it could very well be but we shall see. Sharks are how old? How about Lobsters? Crabs are partially land dwelling, there are billion year old ants, felines are 10 million or so years old.. and there are new species being found each year. Wolves are about 750K years old. Some species adapted to earth changes and some didn't. Again, all I can say is that this thing is much bigger than we are so, that's my statement, having read all of the dire predictions that never came true and knowing that volcanic activity created the Isthmus of Panama, splitting the great ocean into two oceans, helping to melt snowball earth. To me, this earth thing and it's systems are unspeakably powerful. Have you seen what's happened in Detroit? So many people moved out that nature took over and took down buildings, all by itself.

It couldn&#39;t possibly be any folly on my part, surely. &quot;<br />Because It&#39;s one thing to write a wall of one thousand points that any laymen couldn&#39;t ever conclusively verify, and then ride the wave of a million uneducated praises for &quot;revealing the truth&quot; by a horde of people who wouldn&#39;t even have the means to conclusively verify that fact, even if their life depended on it.<br />To expect to PROPERLY debunk large sections of established, working scientific bodies like this, i would expect FOR IT TO TAKE A LOT MORE THAN 40 MINUTES... to do.

But kinda reinforced the point of my post. "What about my papers etc?" EXACTLY... what about them? You literally just finished telling us how wrong everyone's studies were, how exactly does the layman expect to be able to conclusively determine that yours magically somehow isnt?... because youre _telling_ us It's correct?Sounds rather familiar, don't you think? How does partcle forcing negate climate change?( i.e. global warming , i.e. generally what's implied by the term within layman circles) Wouldn't it just add to it? They've been saying for years now that it's all actually much worse than models previously predicted, obviously revealing the prediction models are exactly that, prediction models. One would expect that means that at least anyone understands that they're essentially far from perfect and very much a work in progress. So OFC I do HOPE you or anyone might expand on the science. but you dont even begin to explain exactly how this replaces the idea of combating climate change, rather than essentially just joining it. People are still going to just interperate this according to their own versions of their story.

There isn’t anything anyone can say to them that will change their minds, because they are rooted in their current thinking. Their grip on political power is based on this thought, and, since what they really want is the power to control people to do whatever it is that they want them to do, facts contrary to their beliefs will never compute. Anthropogenic Climate Change is a religious belief. It is a held matter of faith—that is why critics are called “deniers” rather than “skeptics”. Deniers are doomed to hell for the mortal sin. of disbelief. Ask AOC, or Senator Markey, or any of the believers.

What actual data do you have to counter the data that we do have that global warming did not start rapidly increasing in the mid 19th century? I have personally worked with Geologic data studying the geologic history of climate change and compared what we have seen in the past with what we are seeing today. The correlations are irrefutable. I ask you, with the known amounts of hundreds of billions of tons of formerly sequestered CO2 mankind is putting into the atmosphere, and the known historically accurate calculable rates at which this will cause warming. How can you deny that anthropogenic global warming is not having a deleterious effect on global warming? We know we are putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in one week than all natural processes put into the atmosphere in one year. I ask you how is that not having an effect?

Ugyc4_aSLH85RIdF-0N4AaABAg	0	1	2019-03-10 15:38:53	Taisting the Air	My assessment of climate change would be to compare the percent difference between NATURAL climate effects (Orbit, Volcanic, Tectonic and earth element interactions) and the introduction of human influences (city light, heat, noise, chemical imbalances and earth alterations). <br />On the local level some areas might be drastically effected by human influence because of the limited resources or ability of the environment to absorb or adjust to the amount of human influence. These areas need to be controlled and human interaction adjusted to create a balance that the environment can cope with. <br /><br />In the past many errors were made in controlling human interaction such as the lack of water in some California areas which resulted in stealing water from other areas of the country that caused devastation in those areas which could not handle the leaching of its resources. YET, nothing is done to fix these kinds of problems. <br /><br />I consider &quot;climate change&quot; on the world stage to be overwhelmingly controlled by the natural effects that influence earths balances which man has little or no ability to adjust or change. <br />When you consider that one volcanic eruption often introduces much more to influence the climate than humans have in all their history on earth then it is clear that the &quot;climate change&quot; protagonists have a different agenda. <br />This is by no means an effort to excuse human influences that pollute and destroy environments, we are charge with protecting and cultivating our environment. <br /><br />My observation has revealed to me that there is a scheme to pilfer financial resources from government systems into the pockets of people that are promoting that world &quot;climate change is caused by human influences. <br />In the USA money for grants are handed out to scientists who in turn donate back to those politicians who support their research. This cycle is also done with companies for contracts directly or indirectly in other areas besides &quot;climate change&quot;. <br />Because of this the real issues and data is distorted to favor the supporting parties and we end up with fabricated issues that are being promoted and taught to be realistic effects and influences instead of focusing on having reasonable pollution solutions and control and learning how to deal with the natural influences that threaten human survival.

UgwnZ7u5n5zCOpf32u94AaABAg	7	3	2019-03-10 07:14:46	Jesse Parrish	&quot;Climate Variability = Natural Variability + Human Changes&quot;<br /><br />The speaker immediately runs into a problem, not only in the &#39;admittedly oversimplified&#39; sense: the assumption that these variables are even remotely separable and linear. Separating human changes and natural variability in this way is a non-starter; if we restrict attention to a single human factor - the emission of CO2 - the first term, namely &#39;Natural Variability&#39;, is impacted to such a degree that the effect is swamping. If we look at a single variable, such as changes in 5 year-adjusted global temperature on the left hand side, then this is a partial function of water vapor in the atmosphere, which is itself increased given rising temperatures, itself a partial function of CO2. There are several and sometimes conflicting feedback mechanisms which come into play given changes in atmospheric concentrations of CO2. There is no separating &quot;in a 100% accurate way&quot; what &quot;The Earth is naturally doing&quot; versus &quot;what humans are doing.&quot; The same great physics applies to these things simultaneously and without prejudice, and it does not separate them. <br /><br /><br />Skip ahead a few slides. Albedo is not an independent term: it is very much a function of ice coverage. The cooling effect of particulates - whether produced in plants or by volcanoes - is also not independent. Human activity is independent of solar output or orbit, but the latter term is not affecting trends on the order of decades and the former term is carefully measured and not the primary driver of recent changes. <br /><br /><br />There is a special stupidity in saying, &quot;very, very simple,&quot; you add these two things together, and you get &quot;the total climate change.&quot; We can meaningfully ask causal questions. For example: if humans had never burned fossil fuels, what would average surface temperatures be today versus what they are now? If we were to reduce emissions by such and such percent over the next such and such years, what would we expect in terms of the severity of drought in the Southwestern United States in such and such time? We can answer these questions, partially, to a reasonable degree of precision.<br /><br />This is all in prelude to the argument that Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) is unaccounted for by mainstream climate predictions. We can follow the source for the graphs:<br /><br /><a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/data/tsi-data/?doing_wp_cron=1552197755.2082979679107666015625">http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/data/tsi-data/?doing_wp_cron=1552197755.2082979679107666015625</a><br /><a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/data/sorce/total_solar_irradiance_plots/tim_level3_tsi_24hour_640x480.png">http://lasp.colorado.edu/data/sorce/total_solar_irradiance_plots/tim_level3_tsi_24hour_640x480.png</a><br /><br /><br />If we continue to Dr. Greg Kopp&#39;s page:<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://spot.colorado.edu/~koppg/TSI/#TSI_data_record">https://spot.colorado.edu/~koppg/TSI/#TSI_data_record</a><br /><br /><br />Note the SORCE data from the last 38 years, and the Total Solar Irradiance Composite graph on the bottom right: there is that famous, roughly solid 11-year cycle, and with a relatively low-amplitude curve for the current cycle (~2008-2019) as opposed to the previous one (~1997-2008). The patterns of flares are not arbitrarily omitted. Per the same page, prefacing a graph of TSI for a Solar Flare in 2003:<br /><br />&quot;While flares are readily detectable at short wavelengths, where the Sun generally has relatively low signal, their contribution to the entire energy output from the Sun is almost negligibly small, making them extremely difficult to detect in TSI. Nevertheless, TSI observations provide a direct means of measuring the total radiant energy output from a flare, as these measurements integrate solar energy over all wavelengths.&quot;<br /><br /><br />(For a more up to date assessment of this record, see here: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258772303_Assessment_of_the_Solar_Irradiance_Record_for_Climate_Studies)">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258772303_Assessment_of_the_Solar_Irradiance_Record_for_Climate_Studies)</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Using this same source, Camp and Tung measure the variance of solar forcing at about 0.2K over the solar cycles covered by the data (a total of 4.5 upon publication in 2007): (<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Surface-warming-by-the-solar-cycle-as-revealed-by-Camp-Tung/aa31a54d467e66ed9a36180d24338940edc11aee?navId=citing-papers)">https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Surface-warming-by-the-solar-cycle-as-revealed-by-Camp-Tung/aa31a54d467e66ed9a36180d24338940edc11aee?navId=citing-papers)</a><br /><br /><br />If the speaker has been so kind as to publish a real paper with real calculations, I would be happy to review them.<br /><br /><br />As it is, you conclude with a summary of these supposedly unaccounted-for factors being tiled under &quot;blamed on humans.&quot; To my knowledge, none of the listed factors are actually shown to be increasing over the last century, more recently, or in any terms other than the variance of the 11-year solar cycle. If this is mistaken, show the data, calculate the energy, show how it is distributed, then propose a readjustment of the estimated human impact on our current warming trend on the basis of that adjustment. If you want to argue that climate has been significantly effected by forcings that we have yet to account for, show the math.

I have a question concerning your usage of the Rutgers Snow Lab graphs which you employ beginning at @33:15. NOAA maintains a live copy of a combined graph of Sea Ice extent + Snow Cover extent here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/extent/sea-ice/N/0 It shows a steady decline in overall coverage for ALL seasons, not just Spring. The question of overall long-term albedo reduction in the Northern hemisphere is surely a function of the combined data, and not simply terrestrial snow cover. Yes, they use the same source. Perhaps this was brought up to address the argument at climate.gov and imply there was a cynical omission. Let's look at the source: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-spring-snow-cover Under Highlights: "The Northern Hemisphere's land snow cover averaged 25.8 million square kilometers (9.96 million square miles) in 2017, making it the eighth largest snow cover on record." I think you misunderstood the point of the article. The author was not arguing that overall snow cover has been reduced, rather the focus on Spring snow cover was for this stated reason: "At regional and local scales, water resource managers, flood forecasters, and farmers are intensely interested in knowing how much water is in snow and when it will melt. Locally, snow provides moisture to soil and plants. On a larger scale, runoff from melting snow feeds streams and rivers that supply water for agriculture and cities. Knowing when and how quickly snow will turn to water is essential for forecasting if water from snowmelt will soak into the ground or cause flooding. In managed watersheds, earlier melting of snow can change when and how much water is available for various uses." That sounds accurate. That sounds like perfectly appropriate "data selection," even if it is from a science writer and not a publishing climatologist. There's a lot more in your presentation worth parsing. However, I'd most like your math and your source for Dr. Kopp backtracking. EDIT: I would particularly like the math you reference at @28:35, claiming in particular that the effect of medium energy of electrons reduces the forcing effect of CO2 to zero. I have found some recent research on medium energy (30kev-1000kev) electrons here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326867335_An_updated_model_providing_long-term_datasets_of_energetic_electron_precipitation_including_zonal_dependence_EEP_MODEL_INCLUDING_MLT If you follow the citations, you will find that medium energy electron flux has been monitored for some years now. I would like to know what calculation you discovered that the folks at NOAA collecting the data missed.

Then I studied plate tectonics and how the ancient 139,000 square mile lake Chad, now a desert, 8,000 miles from what used to be it's neighbor, is so abundant with biological material that it flows on the wind and fertilizes the Amazon. The desert fertilizes the Amazon.. wow. Then there's the fact that there are, at every moment, about 30 active volcanoes spewing into the atmosphere.. then there's that big yellow thing in the sky that makes flares, sometimes stops making spots, solar wind and hell, a ton of things on AND off earth that effect our weather / climate. Hasn't it also been said that the ENTIRE solar system is warming? Must be those dang SUV's.

I happen to believe that the forces on climate are MUCH BIGGER than we know. There are more of them than are included in predictions. That is my perception and belief. I might be a fool but we'll find out. In the meantime, AOC's New Green Deal is utter insanity. Again, my belief based on many factors. I think I've stated my concerns, opinions, etc., clearly enough and bottom line is that I do not believe there is a looming catastrophe- excepting a coronal mass ejection or an unseen asteroid.. maybe a super volcanic eruption from the 100 mile wide caldera in Yellowstone. Nature is a VERY nasty thing. It wants to kill all of us. It's also a very pretty thing and in some ways fragile but I don't think the current catastrophic beliefs are correct.

Honestly.. this thing is So BIG that I don't think there is enough data in the pot. The pie is half baked because we don't fully understand all of the cycles the earth's system go through. We don't understand all of the effects of the sun, the spots, the flares, the Coronal Mass ejections.. cycles of the ocean.. how they affect climate. Volcanic activity- isn't it true that at any given moment there are 30 volcanoes spewing into the atmosphere? And which layer of the atmosphere is the most relevant to our weather with regard to all of these variables from earth and from the sun and solar system? I am not a scientist, to be sure, but I do read and listen and watch and think. What about other geological forces? Plate tectonics? Oil and gas spewing out of the ocean.. microbes that eat oil. El Nino, La Nina, (could be spelled wrong), unknown cycles of more earth systems.. it truly seems like hubris to think that a species that occupies 9% of the landmass can do SO MUCH damage.. 72% of this planet is water and only a TINY portion of it has been researched. It's GIGANTIC and unspeakably powerful. It eats and creates C02, as I'm sure you know. I'm not can't saying we can't do SOME amount of damage but are you aware that if we did EVERYTHING that is being suggested, we MIGHT affect the global temperature by the slightest fraction of a degree by 2100? It truly appears to be complete insanity to do ANYTHING other than work toward cleaner technologies while making the ones we have cleaner, as well. Our ENTIRE LIFE depends on oil and coal for heat and cooling and running all of our electrical devices. Petroleum is the base for over 6,000 items we use, wear, live in, every day. Ready to give up your cell phone? We can't destroy the economy and go back to the stone age to MAYBE affect a minuscule fraction of a degree of warmth in 82 years. Green technologies will improve and when a company develops a CHEAP and HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL way to implement clean, efficient alternatives, EVERYONE will be a consumer of THAT product. Let the market do it's magic. IT WILL. The government is incompetent, hysterical and full of ignorant, corrupt grand standers who virtue signal and profess their compassion for the children of the future for votes while trying to get MORE MONEY from us. They already get so much.. our President has said, "we have more money than we know what to do with" and I absolutely, positively agree with him. The waste and fraud is horrifying. And no borders... sure, just let everyone in from every 3rd world country with what ever pathogens they carry that we don't have immunity for. Think they've been vaccinated? It's all such a TERRIBLE mess and we're going to sink 93 TRILLION into getting rid of cows, cars and planes??? OMG.

It doesn't fit the agenda. Ignored by the media as well. There should be a ROBUST discussion in the media but, unfortunately, there isn't. Ego has taken over and now we have everyone putting their own interest above the truth. Very sad stuff. Science that questions the current agenda is, as far as I can tell, never govt funded nor does it receive funding from the 64 Billion dollar green lobby. Here is a video of some scientists who are questioning the current "consensus" and when you see how the 97% was calculated, it should give you great pause. These are earth, atmospheric and solar scientists and professional engineers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np_CHy9ql4M&fbclid=IwAR1QKxgLPB2UDswm6sAmWqA7nIgSQ8T57P0t12pRTaAouQjn9BbKTsNfqFU. You can also see a large number of quotes and proclamations and predictions that have been made by renown scientists for nearly 100 years, in newspaper articles in Tony Heller's videos. You may question him but it's a bit hard to refute the statements of the scientists, themselves.

Enough to determine it was yet again the same tiresome stuff. Issue with graphs is not that they are incorrect (they may or may not be, it does not even matter), but that they are taken out of context to construct a misleading narrative. My remark about the lack of math is general. Climate change skeptics do not make any effort to seriously quantity their arguments, certainly not in a way that encompasses all observations and known physics. It's armchair "science" from the peanut gallery, and your presentation is yet another example of such.

You said in one sentence what I said with many more words.  People tend to mistake the finger pointing at the Moon for the Moon. CO2 increase is an effect and not the cause of naturally occurring climate change.  Human impact in my opinion still has to be fully understood. The role of CO2, and of man-made CO2, is overestimated. The impact of the Sun in climate change is on the other end largely underestimated.  Definitely humans are impacting the planet's ecosystem, but this happens in other ways, for example trough chemical pollution. That is a real threat. Not the only one though.	UCFL0u-WufaDCXnFouvnwMOg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFL0u-WufaDCXnFouvnwMOg	1	UgwwYsSB9KNPL3AMEWx4AaABAg	Sebastian Naslund

Or how much impact from a certain number of rail cars or tons of coal vaporized per day into the atmosphere, or of combustible gases, how much of that is released into the atmosphere intentionally by burning or otherwise. There must also be some comparison of this man caused atmospheric augmentation of matter to the impact of one or more volcanoes erupting for a given period of time. Its obviously not going to be an inconsequential number once we start getting honest about such matters. The metrics that activists and anti-activists like to debate can be endlessly debated. 85 million barrels of oil per day is not a matter of debate.

Real scientists are experts in very narrow fields of study. But here's the thing. The natural phenomena being studied in one area almost always affect multiple other areas. So when scientists in one field reach a conclusion about something, but the expected effects on another area are not seen, then that's an indication that some conclusions are wrong or there are some things missing from the models. That is part of the self correcting nature of science. That is what people like young earth creationists, or evolution deniers or climate science deniers don't understand. These theories impact dozens of independent fields of research being conducted by thousands, if not tens of thousands of scientists all over the world. That is another thing that these conspiracy theorists can't seem to get into their thick skulls. Science is an international endeavour, and yet so many of their arguments involve the internal politics of their country. Now I'm not putting you in the same category as these idiots as I've not seen enough of your claims to make a judgement. All I did was look at you web site to see what your background was and found hat you have no credibility. You are not a scientist and therefore are not worth paying attention to on any scientific subject. Especially when you are opposed to the current consensus. Sorry for the length.

Maybe you should put some actual science credentials on it, so when people decide to check you out, it doesn't scream lawyer. Regardless, you oppose the scientific consensus by your own admission. So most of the people in the world who are genuine experts on the subject do not agree with you. If you were a genuine scientist, your efforts should be toward winning a consensus with published research. Until you do, no one outside the scientific community should pay any attention to you since they are in no way qualified to tell if anything you say is legit. As for peer reviewed papers, are they in respected journals? Because I can point you to 'science' journals who will publish anything if you pay them, and others who publish papers supporting young earth creationism, ghosts, crystal healing and alien abductions. And the same goes for 'colleges'. Now I might be wrong about you, but you throw up so many red flags that I dismissed you as a kook with an agenda.

They own the media, they own the bbc and can put out there what they want. We now see that youtube itself filters out what it is told to, because it does not fit with the corrupt agenda.<br />So until we vilify population expansion there is no point in even discussing climate anything, as people who have nothing and see what the west has created for itself are not interested in pollution or climate change, they just want the latest phone or more cheap nutritionally void food and so on.<br />The people who go on marches against global warming have phones, use cars or public transport and go home and put the heating on. Use products containing palm oil.<br />But have no concept of what the opposite reaction is and that is, to turn the energy supply off and see how long you last.<br />Look at for example, the Ethiopian famine in the 80&#39;s where all the pop stars, phil collins, bono, geldoff all got on the band wagon to end poverty and starvation. The cure is not food but birth control, an opinion that attracted a lot of flak to say the least. Ethiopian population in 1982 20 million, now 100 million and still starving.<br />The population in the UK was reducing, people in the UK were having less children, similar to Japan but the government then decided to increase immigration exponentially so the efforts of the majority became futile.<br />The point I am making is simple and that is that, people on mass will not change, their indoctrinated way of life or the population explosion. The more humans there are the more food required, the greater the pollution.	UCPwrwvPPjm74qk4ZQftB7Sg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPwrwvPPjm74qk4ZQftB7Sg	0

Plus we cannot accurately measure any of the three quantities you have chosen for your "equations". We can only estimate them. Now I cannot see what I said due to the way this particular comment system works as I've gone on to more important things, but didn't I already point that out? "being undefined" does not equal "being incapable of being represented in a model. However, not being properly estimated does mean any attempt to incorporate them into a model will likely fail. Read chapter 9 of IPCC AR5. You might learn something. You're the one who keeps insisting on "undefined". That's not the same as "not properly measured, only estimated, poorly".

Falling Minority unemployment which has been going on for years Years of Strong Alliances...(Trump has Stopped that) Years of increasing Free Enterprise (Trump has stopped that with is TRADE WARS) What we have is an Ultra NATIONALIST (not a Republican) in the White House. What we have is the SWAMP Elected to the White House...and the most Corrupt Administration in US HISTORY. ----------------------------------------- 1. Trump has loudly criticized the NATO military alliance as unduly burdensome for the United States. HE Even Suggested that Defending NATO MEMBER (paid Up) Montenegro would hardly be worth World War III. Sounds like Neville Chamberlain SELLING OUT Czeckoslovakia...and announcing PEACE IN OUR TIME! TRUMP knew when he made that statement...that Bloody Putin had stationed the Newest Troops and TANKS along the Eastern European Border! . 2. He has started a trade war with many of those same allies. . (((Japan & the European Union formed the world's LARGEST Free Trade Zone, completely without the USA)))----------------> There is US leadership under TRUMP....way under Trump! . ( Remember the Good Old Day when the US was leader of the world and Ally of the European Union & Japan) 3. And on his way to the G-7 summit of industrialized democracies Friday morning, he suggested that those nations re-admit Russia to the gathering ( ? ) even though Russia continues to occupy part of Ukraine AND Occupies all of the Crimea, Occupies a chunk of Georgia, has never been punished for Genocide in Chechnya, the reason it was expelled from the group in the 1st place. . “If this were a screenplay, Hollywood would have thrown it out as too ridiculous,” said Tom Nichols, a Russia expert at the Naval War College. . “I can’t think of anybody who thinks this is a good idea.” . “Today crystallizes precisely why Putin was so eager to see Trump elected!” said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and the National Security Council spokesman. “For Putin, TRUMP is the return on his investment. It’s safe to say that his investment in Trump & US Election Meddling has paid off beyond even his wildest dreams!” . HELL'S BELLS, A Russian Heavily ARMED and Russian LED mercenary army HAS ATTACKED US TROOPS in Syria a few months ago. Our Ground Commanders tried, for 3 (three) days  to gain authorization from the White House to DEFEND THEMSELVES ! ! ! Having failed to Contact our Commander In Chief, OUR troops HAD to rely on OBAMA ERA standing orders, in order to defend themselves and counter attack. 1. President Trump SAID NOTHING about this RUSSIAN attack 2. President Trump DID NOTHING about this RUSSIAN ATTACK! but he did hold top SECRET meetings with PUTIN. he did invited Putin to Washington, DC for a visit. he was invited BACK to Moscow He did ask that Russia be readmitted to the G8, despite having just attacked US TROOPS. He did kiss the ARS of the RUSSIAN BEAR by GRABBING DEFEAT FROM THE JAWS OF VICTORY & ordered US troops out of Syria...which is precisely what the Russian Oligarch Putin wanted! He did continue to attack European Leaders, Trade Policies, Defense Policies, Nato as Putin wanted. Those European nations HAD NOT ATTACKED US TROOPS. ****	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	Ugw3Edz52-5a4uNBL1R4AaABAg	Guided Meditation

The most common answer I hear is &quot;Carbon Dioxide&quot; which is quite wrong.<br />For the Greenhouse effect, water vapor contributes about 95% of the total effect with CO2 contributing about 5%.<br />And as regards that 5% contribution by CO2, Mankind is contributing about 5% of that. So from carbon dioxide contributions from mankind, that means that we&#39;re increasing the Greenhouse effect by about 0.25%	UCvXOJAuLy3TeBnq4t0IgzpA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvXOJAuLy3TeBnq4t0IgzpA	0

So more sunlight is reflected back into space and less strikes the Earth's surface to become heat. An equilibrium is eventually struck. The true risk comes from cooling; ice sheets grow larger and then we have a runaway effect. Increasing the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere actually serves as a buffer against that eventuality.

CO2 does have a warming effect, this was understood 130 years ago and has not been disproved. Warmer air is able to hold more water vapor, so as CO2 increases so too does water vapour. This is just one of the many feedback loops that contributes to climate change. This is why a small change in a system can create a lot instability.

Rubbish. It’s not social spending that’s causing the federal deficit to soar. It’s Republican tax cuts, especially on corporations and the wealthy. Look at the evidence. Of all 35 advanced economies, America’s spending on social programs like Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid is among the lowest, as you can see. Also, Americans pay into Social Security and Medicare throughout their entire working lives.

CO2 has beneficially enabled life on Earth. (holding infra-red heat/warming the planet so life may proliferate)(has some fertilizer effect, more for weeds than crops) (without CO2 + other Green House gases, Earth would be a Cold ROCK 0 degrees F.) . This is the story of a little is good but a lot is deadly...consider Aspirin, for example. . The Goldi Locks Level for humans of atmospheric CO2 has always been between 180ppm & 300ppm! OUR ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGY IS BASED ON THOSE NUMBERS 180ppm to300ppm. We evolved to meet these numbers 180ppm to 300ppm over hundreds of thousands of years. We have no idea what increasing those gasses in our atmosphere will do to our grand Children's DNA. We have NEVER existed outside of these levels of atmospheric gasses. . Every Year a human has walked on Earth (hundreds of thousands of years) CO2 & other Gasses have ALWAYS been between 180ppm and 300ppm. . 2. CO2 has boosted plant life on Earth provided the required Nutrients, Minerals & H2O increase in the proportion BUT Coincidentally, as CO2 levels have increased, Nutrient values of Grains the world has grown dependent upon, have FALLEN at a Faster Rate! * LESS Iron * LESS Calcium * LESS Protein * LESS Zinc * LESS Copper etc. * IN all of the Staple Grains that the world has become dependent upon !

The fact that CO2 does stimulate some plant growth does not mean it is good for humans or animals. YOU DO KNOW that humans EXHALE CO2 because it is a TOXIC BYPRODUCT of our digestive system. Just like PEE and POOP it can fertilize but I wouldn't suggest you eat the veggies you fertilize with poop. ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT to Generate CO2 for Greenhouses has clear bold type faced warnings about limiting exposure to higher levels Of CO2. . "CO2 Health Impacts in Confined Indoor Spaces A considerable amount of recent literature worldwide has documented CO2 impacts in classrooms from kindergartens to universities (Bako-Biro et al 2011; Widory and Javoy 2003; Kukadia et al. 2005; Dijken et al. 5 2005; Branco et al. 2015; Heudorf et al. 2009; Santamouris et al. 2008; Ferreira and Cardoso 2014; Gaihre et al. 2014; Jurado, et al. 2014; Lee and Chang 2000; Muscatiello et al 2015; Carreiro-Martins et al. 2014). Most agree levels of CO2 in 20-50% of classrooms commonly exceed 1,000 ppm and are often as high as 6,000 ppm for extended periods. Recorded impacts on health are of a minor nature but include sneezing, rales, wheezing, rhinitis, and asthma (Carreiro-Martins et al. 2014; Ferreira and Cardoso 2014). Other symptoms; i.e. cough, headache, and irritation of mucous membranes, were also identified (Ferreira and Cardoso 2014). Lack of concentration was associated with CO2 levels above 1,000 ppm. Gaihre et al. (2014) show some neuro-physiologic symptoms (i.e., headache, fatigue, difficulty concentrating) at CO2 levels greater than 1,000 ppm (Muscatiello et al. 2015)." "In workplaces such as offices, high CO2 level impacts show a range of mild health effects similar to classrooms, depending on the number or density of workers and the types of ventilation systems (Lu et al. 2015; Tsai et al. 2012, Seppanen et al. 1999). Such studies make a link between CO2 levels in offices and Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) with workers complaining of headaches, dizziness, fatigue, respiratory tract symptoms, eye symptoms, nasal and mucous membrane symptoms (Seppanen et al. 1999; Lu et al. 2015; Tsai et al. 2012; Vehviläinen et al. 2016). Seppanen et al. (1999)." . . Unless you are a turnip, Kindly be advised that for millions of years, all LIFE on Planet Earth thrived on atmospheric CO2 Gas levels at GOLDILOCKS LEVELS between 180ppm & 300ppm. . THRIVED! For Many Millions of years...why on god's green earth would you be advocating arguing with SUCCESS! HUMAN SUCCESS. TURNIPS SUCCESS. Those CO2 numbers (( 180ppm--300ppm )) are the Goldilocks levels for all mankind! At those levels, Mankind was created, evolved and, according to the Biblical Imperative, became Fruitful and Multiplied. . It is a shameful expression of man's arrogance that we are mindlessly changing those numbers upon which our Creation & Entire Physiology are based. We have no long term medical studies which indicate the Health Effects of such a dramatic increase in atmospheric gasses...we have not studies indicating what damage may be done to our childrens DNA.

It was much warmer in the 1930s, the Middles Ages, the Roman period and the Egyptian period than it is today. The oceans have no acidity, they are alkaline. Termites produce 1000% more CO2 than humans. If humans double their CO2 output, that would be a tiny 0.0001% increase as a proposition of the atmosphere. Raising CO2 levels will help plants to grow, reducing the amount of farmland required, improving biodiversity, greening the planet as well as helping to raise oxygen levels, good for animals. Carbon and oxygen, the two building blocks of life have been sequested by dead organisms trapping them in sediment, threatening life on earth, human beings by releasing them are saving the planet. 300 parts per million was dangerously low, adding 100 parts per million has been wholly beneficial, adding another 100 parts will still be at suboptimal levels for flora. CO2 is a life giving trace gas, at 0.0004% of the atmosphere there is not enough.

First of all by mid century we'll be pushing to CO2 level into the ranges not seen for 25+ million year. The average species is only about 2 million years old--what that means is the vast majority of life on Earth did not evolve or ever never seen such conditions: not temperatures, not humidity, not the acidity of the oceans. It's also happening on only a couple centuries where most pre-historical examples of similar rises took on the order of 10000 years or more.

The increase has only been 1 part in 10000 of the atmosphere, a tiny but beneficial amount; encouraging plant growth for the benefit of the earth's animals including the naked ape. CO2 is the building block of life, optimum levels for organic life are in excess of 1600 parts per million, 300% more than we have today. By burning fossil fuels we are simply returning to the atmosphere the oxygen and carbon locked up by deceased animals, we are saving life on the planet by doing so.

I&#39;ve studied this problem for over fifty years, so by that reckoning, I&#39;m now old and crazy. I always thought Relativity was incorrect though mathematically balanced, which made me look for the reason. It is due to the fact that nothing may be divided equally into two. We suppose otherwise, so all of our mathematics is essentially arbitrarily determined, and necessarily fictitious. The other part of this problem in physics is that the mathematical tool is zero-based. In other words, the answer to any inquiry as to the physics of the universe is presumed before any equivalences are made. When I figured that out, I decided to try to find out why the planets maintain their orbits despite billions of years (earth cycles) of stability. The sun as I&#39;m sure all of you know is a million times more massive than the earth. We should have &#39;joined the party&#39; at the solar center eons ago. I decided to consider the planets as pendulum bobs. When I did that and compared all the planetary cycles to Jupiter&#39;s, all of the planets were indeed actively attracted to the sun as shown by an orderly graph. What has never been considered is what is the tension on the &#39;cord&#39; suspending the bob (s)? It turns out that the galaxy fixes the cord. The planets move counter to the sun&#39;s galactic motion on its galactic orbit during half an annual cycle. That accounts for the balancing force. The question is, does human activity compare even in the slightest to the force of the galaxy itself? When a volcano blows its top, how does that compare to the fuel burnt in the USA? What about tectonic upheavals in general? We are SO presumptuous!	UC6vir2J8d9UYlpwoxQ9Rl1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vir2J8d9UYlpwoxQ9Rl1w	0

If in the case of the sun the attractive gravitational force acts in all directions perpendicular from the surface, then any planetary motion on a circular path of its orbit's circumference will have no resistance to such an attractive force and will in effect appear as without motion except towards the sun. The planets should, therefore, be accelerating directly towards the sun. This isn't happening.

The man made CO2 volume added to the atmosphere and the raw data that all high volume of that CO2 causes.

The amount of CO2 humans have pumped into the atmosphere is calculabe, the heat holding properties of the molecule is calculable. Saying your specific areas you probed mean that CO2 is not relevant makes your proposal less relevant. Do your next video on CO2 changes in the atmosphere and run calculations there then you will know why oceans are acidifying, and storms are getting stronger and more common, and why ocean levels are rising (facts you can't disagree with).

Polar Shift. &#39;Cuz the North Pole (magnetic) ain&#39;t atop the Arctic anymore, folks. It&#39;s moved 1,700 miles since 1833. Basically, it&#39;s now in Siberia. If it settled there, Toronto (relative equatorial position) would become the new Miami. Clearly, if you move Toronto to Miami... you&#39;re gonna experience &quot;climate change&quot;. This was covered in January 2019 science journal Nature. It&#39;s also corrupted ALL electronic navigation data. US govt has sent new sats up the last 2 yrs attempting to compensate.

Time and again we are told that the Maldives are going to disappear under the "rising sea levels" as their land is around 1m above sea levels, yet time & again this fails to happen. Why are they currently building new Airport runways, hundreds of thousands of houses and ever more hotels if they are all going to drown & have to leave? You would also have thought no insurance companies would touch them, yet the facts reveal quite the opposite and investment in the Maldives continues to expand dramatiically. They were supposed to be underwater by the 80's, then the early 2000's, then by this year & yet again we are told it will be in "10-30 years". Funny how it is always "10 years to save the world" isn't it?

Have you ever watched a leftist attempt to debate a Conservative on important issues? The Conservative will cite statistics, facts, expert opinions, etc. and the leftists will counter with: &quot;Yeah, well you&#39;re just a fucking racist!&quot;. People really need to pay attention to what these leftist teachers and professors are teaching our children- at all ages.

They concluded that out of all papers that took a stance on the nature of the current climate, 97% *explicitly* agrees that we are currently experiencing rapid warming and that human activity is the main driver of this warming. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002	UClcDA42FaiwQMW1H6WVlsNw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcDA42FaiwQMW1H6WVlsNw	1	UgwuezzIFkZRchtxPsF4AaABAg	Freedom Talk Media

I do not beleive most climate change proponents are part of a conspiricy against capitalism and the developed nations. But I am not convinced the dire predictions by climate change models are correct. We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and minimize our negative impact on the planet as a priority. But I do not beleive we are doomed or that it is too late. I think the models overstate the problem, and we have time to make changes if we act now.	UC2eLjcENKq_4IdqhMAFqC7g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eLjcENKq_4IdqhMAFqC7g	0

The IPCC literally takes both solar influence and historic data into account in their common report. I will admit that their website is actually incomrehendible, but that is because it is designed for science, and not the common public. Something I think they should reconsider. <br /><br />Nonetheless, don&#39;t be fooled by this video. It is just one man talking, picking out the examples which suit his case. It&#39;s so much easier to just watch this video compared to reading the whole bloody boring IPCC update. But the IPCC update is more accurate.

It is a tiny amount, and all that is currently used in climate models by the alarmists. What needs to be included (which is slowly starting to be included in the data but still left out of the models) is the energetic particle forcing & coupling via the Global Electrical Circuits and they do not even begin to consider the effects of the relativistic particles. You need to get rid of TSI as the sole factor - that is your mistake.	UCE_7VMWEI9HjTfXgPmpXtSg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_7VMWEI9HjTfXgPmpXtSg	1	UgzgXsvET45Lxhc8eN14AaABAg	Genlab

The YouTube video just reiterated what I had only known. if you would have read my link it says it in the link. but I gave you several links that talk about the 35 mile an hour information that you were looking for. I'm not sure where the YouTube video is. I'll keep an eye out for it. and if I find it I'll share it with you. I did look around for it but I haven't seen it yet. I saved it among hundreds of other videos I have. At home I have my guess is 5000 videos or more sunburned on DVD so it may take awhile when I run across that again. But the information I gave you besides the women thing. Talks about the same thing that's in the video how about the 35 mile an hour deal and how people thought they would pass out if they went past that speed and about how they didn't think people could go that fast without certain implications happening to them. And yes scientist believed it too you can find that in science journals of the time. I'm not going to do your homework for you.

That is just one path - Ultraviolet Radiative forcing ending in Thermal Coupling. Now go look at this presentation, and please read - carefully - at 13:46 where you will see the true Solar Forcing paths - and remember the only one currently accepted by IPCC is the far right Radiative Forcing path. Ben is not making this stuff up - every comment in this can be backed up by serious papers. We live in an interconnected electrically dominant solar system in an electrical universe. CO2 = Plant Food, nothing more. Any warming effects it may have pale into insignificance when the full reality of solar & space weather forcing is properly considered. AGW is alarmist nonsense and moreover I have lost count of all the failed predictions of doom.

If I were to stand in the middle of a street, and a car would hit me at about 50 km/h, there is a great chance I would be dead. On the other hand astronauts in the International Space Station survive orbiting the earth at speeds of five miles a second. I believe you when you say that many years ago there were some scientists who actually thought the human body could not withstand any speed over 35 mi/h. But you will have to agree with me they were proven wrong very quickly once the first vehicles capable of achieving this speed were introduced. Empirical evidence kind of killed that assumption. The IPCC is nothing more - or less - than an international institute funded by the UN to compare reports based on empirical evidence. But for argument's sake let us pretend the IPCC did not exist. You would still be left with an overwhelming set of data from all over the world, interpreted in reports by scientists, and subject to peer-to-peer reviews. And you will find that all major universities and meteorological institutes on this planet come to the same conclusions as the IPCC does. I absolutely love debating on Youtube, but I'm going to set a rule on your reply. I challenge you to name just ONE university of any substance to prove me wrong. This means you will actually have to come up with the name of ANY university that denies the influence of the increased output by humans of carbon dioxide on our climate.

The reports change the definition of statistical validity so that politicians can claim that "somewhat unlikely" means "highly likely." I'm sure because I read it in the reports. One of the first things the reports do is to redefine statistical reliability. All sciences except climate science (and psychiatry) require >95% confidence. That's a fact. That should be the minimum requirement to change public policy, but these socialists are using their "precautionary principle" as part of the hoodwink, breaking all the scientific rules. These people are the science deniers. Global Warming is is the sin-offering-redemption narrative of the Gaia cult.

Their reports do not say the same things as their press releases and summaries for governments. Also, their reports redefine statistical likelihood to something like 68 percent or more. In science, you need a 95 percent confidence interval to use the word "likely." Their results are not statistically certain; their predictions are not statistically likely in their own findings. They know that. So they redefine the term so that their sponsors can say it's "likely" we'll all die for our sins in their new apocalyptic religion. I also read the emails they write to each other.

Still not enough to compensate a global warming, and yes we observe global warming, because the radiative forcing of human CO2 (in compare to pre-industrail era) is 2 Wm-2, methane 0.6Wm-2, after adding other greenhouse gases we have 3.2 Wm-2 (the amplifing effect of water vapor presence was taken into account)	UCPBxexWHxp0P3HMeYMqK80w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPBxexWHxp0P3HMeYMqK80w	1	UgzgXsvET45Lxhc8eN14AaABAg	Genlab

UgygMB-ETN91cenxcnt4AaABAg	4	12	2019-03-08 00:41:55	Galloh	Points of criticism on this video:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYoOcaqCzxo&amp;t=3m20s">3:20</a> - You give the equation C = N + H. You say that if we don&#39;t have N correct then by definition we cannot find H. This implicitly assumes that C can be measured and N can be measured, but H cannot. Why do you assume that N can be measured, but H cannot? This assumption is neither provided for clarity, nor is it explained. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYoOcaqCzxo&amp;t=8m30s">8:30</a> - You point out that some of the natural variability is wrongfully attributed to humans. This is indeed an issue. Undeniable. In fact, I didn&#39;t even know that and I&#39;m happy you taught me that. However, when you say &quot;X-rays are inceased 100-100,000x&quot; this provides no meaningful information. If the energy from X-rays was negligible, does an increase of 100 make it non-negligible or is it still negligible? The fact that the ratio is defined so poorly suggests that data points are within the noise level. Furthermore, it is not explicitly said that these X-rays (and others) actually reach the Earth. It is only said they are ejected more. Considering this is meant to convince people, explicitly saying things is important. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYoOcaqCzxo&amp;t=15m00s">15:00</a> - You say this is a diagram used by many papers. Do you have any sources? The diagram looks like it would not pass any peer-review. Furthermore, it talks about &quot;Electromagnetic particles&quot;. There is no definition of them. Neither in this talk, nor any internationally recognized (just search for the term in google scholar: you won&#39;t find anything about it). You talk about Electromagnetic fields. Especially as you see them as something different from Electromagnetic Waves (i.e. photons), I am wondering: are you talking about a static magnetic or electric field emitted from the sun that has non-neglible values on Earth? That would be news to me!<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYoOcaqCzxo&amp;t=32m20s">32:20</a> - You provide the numbers and the equation for calculating how much energy is converted into heat, but it&#39;s apparently too much to do yourself. Nor do you compare whether this is a significant or not. I get that this talk is about more than just &quot;energy going into Earth contains more natural than you think&quot; (even though the start does suggest that). I get that it is indeed bad that the heating is through the atmospheric insulator is not taking into account. But if we&#39;re going to the &quot;heat comes in, heat goes out&quot;-discussion then it&#39;s important to consider where does the charge come from in the Global Electric Circuit. A quick search tells me solar radiation (i.e. external) and thunderstorms (i.e. internal). What portion of this is external? If you said this just to say &quot;their model is incomplete&quot; then there was no need for the equation on the screen. <br /><br />General:<br />* No references given<br />* Starting the 10-minute mark or so many terms are given and it is vaguely described that &quot;they have an impact&quot; without any quantization, without any formal definition of the terms (see comment above), without any data-graphs. It feels as a &quot;argument by intimidation&quot;-fallacy. And I don&#39;t want to feel like when you&#39;re trying to convince me of something.<br /><br />The general thesis that more things should be included is a good one, and I support it! It&#39;s the first time I hear about any of this, so it&#39;s interesting and I&#39;m glad that people are researching this. I feel like too many people&#39;s take-home message of this video will be &quot;Climate science is wrong&quot; (and from that draw their own conclusion that they can continue using fossil fuels without issue). I know you bring it up in the end - but still.	UCLNZvXmD-1Asl4cjXgrReDQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNZvXmD-1Asl4cjXgrReDQ	0

Thats how they do it. 830- if we see them, they reached us. x-rays and particles hits the ionosphere and magnetosphere, and are funneled either to the polar atmosphere or through the global electric circuit. I gave those heat equations in this video. 1500- You must not know much about space weather and that's ok. The diagram was what happens when you put the papers together. That is the picture. The blackout one is what is ignored by the IPCC and NOAA. The particles are the solar wind, cosmic rays - the fields are the interplanetary magnetic fields and heliospheric current sheet. Both are distinctly different from photons. 3220- Presentations are not the place for math. I did the math, and I gave the number - 30% of the heat budget, as modulated by the sun. These equations are what I discuss in my answer to 830 - How does one put 600 references up? They are all in my book, but I won't ask you to get it. You can literally google anything like "solar forcing ENSO" or "solar forcing polar vortex" or "solar forcing sea surface temperature" -- anything. - The full explanation video you are asking for would be hours long. For that, the book is needed. With respect, would you mind watching this: https://youtu.be/OpImPL61R4s is why 300+ emails on my listserve are NASA/NOAA/USGS scientists or professors at Universities. It is the reason they show up at my conferences, and agree to speak. The list of speakers at our conferences is darned impressive actually...

One of these vessels would contain air identical to our atmosphere but without any CO2. The second would contain air, identical to our atmosphere INCLUDING THE 0.04% CO2 (That&#39;s less than a half of one part in one thousand). The outer chamber should then be completely evacuated (to emulate space). Then heat both of these vessels using identical heat lamps. I&#39;ll wager that the greenhouse effect of that CO2 would be so negligable that it would be impossible to detect. Bearing in mind that most of the CO2 in our atmosphere has NOTHING to do with mankind, we could finally debunk this myth.

The carbon dioxide was reflecting heat back into space. There were talks of coating the poles with industrial soot so the black could capture more heat. It was in all the media. The newspapers were splattered with the news of the impending ice age and how it was scientifically proven. It scared the fecal material out of me being a kid growing in those times. Even classes were stopped so, &quot;environmental awareness experts,&quot; could indoctrinate us about the impending ice age. Television programmes were interrupted so doom could be spread about the impending ice age. It was scary times. The records can still be found in libraries in microfiche and microfilm. Unfortunately, not much has made it to the world wide web. It is probably because it is contrary to the modern scare tactics and the politician&#39;s pending carbondioxide taxes and other agendas. Just go to your local library and start looking at old media that has made it to microfiche and you will not believe the doom that was being spread.

The reason I remember so well is because we had a teacher cry in front of class as she read out of a Scientific American journal about how the Northern hemisphere would be under two and a half miles of ice by 2010. She told us we were going to have it so hard as adults. That terrified me. She mentally imprinted that on my mind. After all, teachers are not supposed to cry.

However, since little of this has made it to the internet, it might as well have never happened. I can not imagine anybody under 30 years of age even thinking about looking up microfiche or microfilm in libraries. This is why I have serious doubt about the human sourced global warming, or is it climate change. I can not keep up. However, I have already started hearing very early talks about another impending ice age. Since none of the politician's theories are being proven true, they keep changing it. The goal is to pass some sort of carbon dioxide tax. That why all of us get taxed for absolutely everything we do, including breathing. Nobody younger than us will bother to look any of these old scare tactics. They are nothing but stupid sheep that will believe anything the government blurts out. Sadly, the politicians have pet, "scientists," they keep in their deep pockets that will say anything they are told to say.

Just like politics the truth and solutions lie somewhere in the middle. When people make predictions, about catastrophes , like Gore did, and they don&#39;t come to pass, it discredits the entire movement. Now, OAC has said the world will end in 12 years. The best way to continue to develop alternative energy and cleaner conventional energy is to release the private sector and its inovation , not by throwing more money at government funded institutions , many of which have political motivations behind their science. If you want a comparison, look at NASA and its partnership with Elon Musk and Space x. Together they are doing amazing things that the bloated bureaucracy of NASA alone would have never been able to accomplish. Auto mobiles continue to get cleaner , jet engines continue to get cleaner. When we see the world increasingly becoming more dangerous daily, due to nuclear proliferation and political instability, maybe we need to concentrate more on these situations, because I have a feeling that nuclear war will suddenly make the climate debate irrelevant some day. Perhaps if bloated governments of the world weren&#39;t using up all of the worlds economic resources, strong economies would be bringing new solutions to these problems. Also, to you scientist out there, why are we not hearing more about hydrogen fusion, is this a possibility, or is it a pipe dream?

But climate change is actually a Celebrity movement of White liberals to transfer wealth to virtue signal other rich white people as the saviours of the planet... When the opposite is true.... Population is the pollution that nobody talks about because it is seen as racist to White Liberal virtue signallers.... All climate talks should add population models as a direct influence of all climate change models. Population equals pollution.

But to go into detail he is explaining some solar things that happens from time to time. right? and these over under thingys arent calculated into model. right? So human effect on climate change cant be determined since these sun flares arent counted in as natural but as human cause. so these flares that last what couple of days hours that produce 1000 times more and 100 times more some other stuff. As far as i understand this. These things stop before or in upper atmosphere and these things should have little to no effect on global warming since they are close to vacuum and temp there arent so high if there is no matter to be heated right?

Therefore we must become aware of the long term effects of, for instance, absorbing wind velocity on weather, removing energy from the sea with wave power, redistribution of light to heat with solar power. All very small amounts at the moment, but, as is usual with humans, we see opportunities and crack on with them (particularly if profit is to be made) having scant regard for possible long term damage, like urrm, coal, oil and nuclear for instance? Who saw the massive pollution of plastics in our oceans, if anyone did, there was no one to listen until the damage was too huge to ignore.<br />My wife says I should include my thought that light received from the sun and turned into power via solar generation is a net contributor to global warming as otherwise the light would dissipate but the power it thus produces, when used, would cause heat, not previously on this planet, to be generated leaving the equivalent fossil fuels untouched and still available.<br />The same could, of course be levelled at foliage which again uses light as fuel during photosynthesis and, when used as a fuel source itself, produces heat and pollutants.

Legendary constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe saw the thread, and said, “I’m with Seth Abramson here.” “Smarmy, slimy, smiling Jared Kushner of 666 Fifth Avenue is the beating heart of this unprecedentedly corrupt and deeply evil administration,” Tribe charged. Professor Tribe has taught at Harvard Law for 50 years and tried 36 cases before the United States Supreme Court. “He’ll eventually be exposed as an insatiably greedy Benedict Arnold,” Tribe predicted. Like Tribe, Abramson had harsh words for Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump. “I’m going to tell you now the chief thing I’ve learned from many months of research for my forthcoming book Proof of Conspiracy: Jared Kushner is now the greatest domestic danger to America,” Abramson argued. “And many former US government officials know for a fact that what I’ve just said is true.” “Whatever you think VP Dick Cheney was to President George W. Bush, take that, make it three times as sinister, make Bush ten times more sociopathic and a devout criminal, and make Cheney stupid, venal, and entirely dismissive of our rule of law and you get what Kushner is to Trump,” he continued. “Kushner is going to get us into a devastating war with Iran. Jared, singlehandedly. Jared, to make money for himself. I’ll say now that Jared more richly deserves to be in prison for the rest of his life than [Paul] Manafort, and Manafort richly deserves it,” Abramson argued. “That’s how bad this is.” “Whether you realize it or not, Kushner having top secret security clearance is the issue in American politics right now, as Trump circumventing our intelligence community to give his son-in-law that access is the shibboleth that made the current danger to America possible,” he said. “We need whistleblowers to blow their whistles now,” Abramson concluded...."

If you want steel you have to burn coal and lots of it. The ash can be used for other things as well. So China can also buy coal from North Korea which is allot closer to China than Utah is and can sell it for less, so we have competition to sell the coal cheaper , billions of dollars in coal maybe a trillion dollars , so a few tax credits it chump change compared what the Feds give out for a nuclear plant. Normally on a nuke plant Feds pay for the plant the electric company pays for the workers and gets to sell the electricity and keep all the profits! What a deal! All clean up is also paid by the Feds. And it's extremely political! Coal oil they don't get that kind of deal! Nuclear power plants don't have to pay back any of the Fed money either. Wow what a scam! So coal has to be competitive and compete with slave labor no rules in North Korea, and more laws you put on coal here the more expensive it becomes and soon Chinese by their Coal from someone else! And our workers are out of work! Lots if support company close to and you have a mess.

COAL gets BILLIONS IN SUPPORTS AND SUBSIDIES...and MORE overseas. "Does the Coal Industry Get Subsidies? . Hey Mr. Green, An acquaintance of mine claims that there are no subsidies for the coal industry. Well? --Bill in Landenberg, Pennsylvania Puzzling out the subsidies to the coal business is as unnerving as edging through a dark mineshaft swarming with Velcro-winged bats. This is because a big chunk of the subsidies are not direct handouts, but packaged as tax credits, tax breaks, and other goodies too numerous to itemize here. The U.S. coal industry enjoyed subsidies of around $17 billion between 2002 and 2008, including tax credits for production of "nonconventional" fuels ($14.1 billion), tax breaks on coal royalties ($986 million), exploration, and development breaks ($342 million), according to a study by the Environmental Law Institute. On top of this federal largesse, state and local governments coddle coal with hundreds of millions per year. The Kentucky state government’s net subsidy to coal is $115 million. Virginia grants tax credits of about $26 million to power plants just to burn Virginia coal, and doles out credits ranging from 40 cents to $2 per ton for another 20 million tons not burned by power plants. Bioregionalism at its finest. Around $1.5 billion of the federal costs are associated with damages to miners’ health such as the notorious black lung disease. Thinking of the miners’ plight lands us smack in a morass of hidden subsidies as thick as the billion gallons of coal-ash sludge that poured into eastern Tennessee in 2008. What is the true health and environmental cost when mining machines rip off mountaintops and chuck the rubble into streams? What was the cost of acid rain? What’s been the healthcare cost of 47 tons per year of mercury from burning coal that put 300,000 fetuses at risk for neurological damage each year? And how do you calculate the cost of coal’s 20 percent contribution to global-warming gases? It doesn't end with this list. There are huge subsidies, direct and indirect, for the coal industry in the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES), H.R. 2454, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives last year. It remains to be seen what will emerge after the Senate has its go at the bill, but the EPA's own analysis notes that there will be substantial subsidies for carbon-capture technology, up to $90 per ton for carbon dioxide that’s "captured" in the first ten years. This is why some critics say it looks more like a "Coal Subsidy Act" than a Clean Energy and Security Act. For those who don’t have time to wade through the 946-page proposed law, Grist provides a valuable summary of welfare for coal here. Among the coal subsidies cited: In the cap-and-trade program, a portion of the 85 percent of emission permits would be given away for free to the coal industry. (The EPA projects the total value of emissions permits to reach $113 billion in 2025.) Energy-intensive industries, which obviously use coal, would get 15 percent of the free permits, while coal would get 5 percent. On top of this, a whopping $60 billion would be dedicated to carbon-capture-and-sequestration technology, the bulk of which would benefit the coal industry. Among the indirect subsidies to coal are $20 billion to develop electric vehicles and other automotive technologies. (As I've noted before, electric cars are not a magical solution to energy waste because EVs require vast amounts of power, much of which will come from coal if we continue on the present course.) Another troubling matter is that our obsessive quest for more and cleaner energy is blinding us to other important environmental issues. Ripping off the tops of mountains and choking streams up with the rubble to mine coal is every bit as noxious as emitting global-warming gases." etc.	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UgzuZqNb7GTKUZ-eyvl4AaABAg	Enquiry News/ Felkins Works

If it wasn't, the "solutions" wouldn't be so bad. I've seen this BS grow. I remember when a global tax on wealthy so they could give the money to the poor. Then as climate change started taking off, it was reintroduced as a way to improve the climate. Can anyone explain how transferring money from one person to another improves the climate? They now came up with ideas that hide that idea more, like carbon credits. How does that work? Well you take money from the high CO² producing countries, (you know, the rich ones,) and give it to the low CO² producing countries, (you know, the poor ones). So how exactly does this reduce CO²? Supposedly that would make it more expensive, resulting in people trying to save money. But then what will the poor country spend that money on? You actually think they are going to spend it on anything to reduce CO² levels? No, they will spend it on things that increase it. More recently America removed itself from a climate agreement. How great was that climate agreement? Well each country made up some number they would cut emissions to, be under no obligations to actually do anything, and to give a ton of money to poor countries. When we pulled out it was funny the countries they used to justify it. "Well this country did it." Well that country was going to get a ton of money, so why wouldn't they sign up? If they were really interested in reducing pollution, shouldn't they be focused on the ones that produce it? All that plastic in the ocean isn't coming from America, in fact practically all of it (as much as 95% according to Daily Mail,) is coming from 10 rivers in Africa (2) and Asia (8). We are talking 2.5 billion tons. Want to talk about CO²? Fracking has resulted in a cut in the CO² emissions in the US. This isn't what people want to hear, but it's true. Fracking has expanded natural gas immensely, reducing it's price. That has caused power plants that can switch to switch, and natural gas is more efficient so it produces less CO². It also burns clean, so there is no waste left over like with coal. The US production of CO² is back to where it was in the 90's. We are the only country to do that. But with the plans to ramp up exports of natural gas, we are about to start exporting those benefits to other countries. With this reduction in CO2, do we still need to pay any carbon credits? Why isn't this reduction more well known? (Although I was surprised it made it to Wikipedia.)

The best bet is simply quit subsidizing those things causing AGW. ((world wide, Fossil Fuels & connected industries TAKE 6.5% of GDP ..TRILLIONS in subsidies/ supports))) . In most cases the newer more modern energy and agricultural systems are more profitable and less damaging to the environment already. So there is no need to tax people to subsidize those things harming the environment, then taxing us again to penalize those same ones we just subsidized! A house divided against itself cannot stand. -Lincoln (paraphrasing the Bible) It is time for a strong political leader to take charge and end this deadlock.

The one thing that won’t work is keep the tax and spend schemes the Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! Yes that’s right, the top two causes for global warming are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity. in·san·i·ty in'san?de/ noun the state of being seriously mentally ill; extreme foolishness or irrationality. We can reverse AGW though, and save money doing it. Here are three proposals. One made by me and two more similar ones. Here you can see how some might include a carbon market and ways we could do it without a carbon market. They are all workable. The main thing is that they are all stand alone solutions that have beneficial sides effects instead of detrimental side effects to the land and society. We should do them even if AGW wasn’t real. They would still be hugely beneficial all around. There is no negative down side. Win/win for all. Credit: Joel Pett | USA Today 1] Scott Strough's answer to Can we reverse global warming? Executive summary: Yes we can reverse Global Warming. It does not require huge tax increases or overly expensive untested risky technologies. It will require a three pronged approach worldwide. 1] Reduce fossil fuel use by replacing energy needs with as many feasible renewables as current technology allows. . ((solar & wind Cost less & are quicker to construct + + they produce FAR less expensive electricity than coal)) . Change Agricultural methods to high yielding regenerative models of production made possible by recent biological & agricultural science advancements. Large scale ecosystem recovery projects similar to the Loess Plateau project, National Parks like Yellowstone etc. where appropriate and applicable. 2] Project Drawdown The list is comprised primarily of “no regrets” solutions—actions that make sense to take regardless of their climate impact since they have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. These initiatives improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health.[5] 3] Farming a climate change solution Farmers have a golden solution to global warming largely missed by climate change pundits, right beneath their feet. The innovative Australian Soil Carbon Accreditation Scheme is showing how incentive payments can be received by landholders for measurable increases in soil carbon that soaks up CO2 from the atmosphere. Financial incentives could help fund soil restoration efforts, which in turn bring the bonus of greater productivity, drought resilience and even rain. The action is deep underground.[6] Footnotes [1] The $200 Billion Fossil Fuel Subsidy You've Never Heard Of (USA) [2] Fossil fuel subsidies are a staggering $5 tn per year | John Abraham [3] Fossil Fuel Subsidies Top $450 Billion Annually, Study Says (USA w various costs,supports) [4] Milking taxpayers [5] Solutions | Drawdown [6] http://www.amazingcarbon.com/PDF...

"The report also found that 52 percent of those plants had unsafe levels of cancer-causing ARSENIC in nearby groundwater while 60 percent showed unsafe levels of LITHIUM, which can cause neurological damage. “Using industry’s own data, our report proves that coal plants are poisoning groundwater nearly everywhere they operate,” - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - "...It’s sometimes claimed that scientists falsify Environmental Statistics & the 150 Yr. old theory of Global Warming in order to receive funding.

ADDITIONALLY " this argument OVERLOOKS all funding provided is strictly controlled / monitored & audited by the funding body or their appointed auditors. Any deliberate misappropriation of funding would be a "criminal offense" for which the offender could be jailed. --------> This has never happened. The Republican Virginia State Attorney – Ken Cuccinelli – embarked on something of a witch-hunt against the climate scientist Dr. Michael Mann invoking *** Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act *** claiming Mann had misappropriated public funds by creating fraudulent climate data.

Killer Coal Execs increase AUTOMATION to forestall the need to hire back employees, but the thousands of open air, Earth-Lined, TOXIC pits & ponds & old mine shafts. Used to store Coal Electric Generated TOXIC WASTES, without appropriate standards or supervision ! . Dumping Toxic Waste is the Cheapest Waste Disposal method. Every year in EACH of the nation’s CLEANEST Killer Coal ELECTRIC GENERATION plants produce 140 million tons of HIGHLY TOXIC COAL ASH WASTE / Year ------> the toxic by-product that is left over after the coal is burned and Smoke is Scrubbed. . THE CLEANEST COAL PLANT still produces MILLIONS of Tons of TOXIC Coal Ash / year. . All that ash has to go somewhere, so it’s dumped in the backyards of power plants across the nation —into earth lined open-air ponds/pits / precarious surface-waste pools. . Most of these sites lack ANY adequate safeguards, leaving nearby communities at risk from potential large-scale disasters like the massive coal ash spill in Tennessee in 2008 & from gradual yet equally dangerous contamination as coal ash toxins seep into drinking water Aquifers or are blown into nearby communities. . Coal ash pollution contains high levels of toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, selenium, lithium, other cancer-causing agents. . The public health hazards & environmental threats to nearby communities from unsafe coal ash dumping have been known for many DECADES, including increased risk of cancer, learning disabilities, neurological disorders, birth defects, reproductive failure, asthma (1 million new cases/yr.), and other illnesses. . Coal ash is not subject to federal supervision, and state laws governing coal combustion waste disposal are weak or nonexistent. . The result: TENS Millions of tons of TOXIC coal ash PRODUCED BY EACH COAL ELECTRIC PLANT are being stored in ponds, landfills, and abandoned mines...in 47 states. Virtually NO SAFETY STANDARDS.

And you can try to pull the wool over all the younger peoples eyes that weren&#39;t there to see how pristine and unaltered the world was when I was a kid. But you can&#39;t fool me. And first of all, the term climate change is not the real issue here. Everyone that uses that term is wrong. The climate is always changing, so that doesn&#39;t really focus on the real problem at hand. It should be called human change, and the effects that that is having on the earth. Don&#39;t misconstrue the issues and hide behind a stupid concept like climate change. It&#39;s human change. And exactly what the humans have done for the last hundred years. The shear numbers of population, the shears numbers in technological change, the shear numbers in ruthless raping of the symbiotic biodiversity of the ecosystem, and the shear numbers of the resultant damage and pollution as a result, just so you corporate pigs could maximise your profits and hoard all of the money for the upper 1%. You corporate assholes can&#39;t fuck with that data or misconstrue it. You are pinned to the sheets, and your actions are coming to kill you, and all of the rest of the living things on earth, because you just wanted to fill your wallets, over and over, until everything has gone into a runaway fuck up of the eco system that has nothing to do with the climate. It&#39;s the ecosystem, and the ability for all of life on earth, that took billions of years to find equilibrium with, which you have ruined in 100 short years. Is that what we were chosen for?

All of Climate Science is, basically, _theories_ on the human component. The models try to model the theories to see if the results match reality, this is the Climate Science equivalent of experiments. In modelling, this is called 'validation'. So far, they've all failed. They have a horrible track record of validating their models. The only thing we can measure directly, and even this is controversial, partly because it's really complicated and partly because what the climate scientists do with it doesn't make sense, is the total effect. Warming or cooling. What's natural and what's man-made, that's all well beyond our real ability to distinguish today.

Clearly the importance of the OP statement flew right over your head. BTW ... the statement is as valid today as it was when it was written. It means that the GCMs (general circulation models) used in projecting future climate outcomes have all filed and will continue to fail. It means that the entire hypothesis plugged into those models is falsified completely. It means the warming since the 19th century is indistinguishable from natural variation. The climate is changing as it always has and should.	UCSt6Pl83bjWbmtZuz6Lg4Cg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSt6Pl83bjWbmtZuz6Lg4Cg	1	Ugx8gwGEhldo5cJFfFZ4AaABAg	xyzct

First round, 2ft wall. Easy. Second round, 4ft wall. You can manage. Third round, 8ft wall. Not without effort. Fourth round, 16ft wall. Nope! Currently we just jumped the 4ft wall, 400ppm. If we increase population by 50%, industry about 30-40% and do absolutely nothing to capture CO² (i.e., don't even do what we do now) we might be able to hit 800ppm in 150 years. But there is no scenario where any sustainable measure of human population plus oversized, unnecessary industry could produce 1600ppm CO², continuously. So we can't get to 4°C, because it already took all this effort just to get to 0.7C, 1.3C, 2.1C, or whatever failed model shows we are at now.

Basically, sensitivity in response to CO2 is asymptotic: if you move your value close to the exponential curve, a small variance in uncertainty has a more dramatic effect on predictions. This is why papers on the subject always have "heavy-tailed" distributions.	UC8W1RV5zajefz8uQ2G8xtBw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8W1RV5zajefz8uQ2G8xtBw	1	Ugx8gwGEhldo5cJFfFZ4AaABAg	xyzct

Science calls all of these, trace gasses. 2nd. CO2 has a multiplier effect with H2O...H2O is 7000 times more abundant than CO2. Between the 2, there is a tremendous forcing effect on climate. Without them, Earth would be a COLD ice rock...3rd from the sun. . "Steven Walter, former Distinguished Professor of Systems Engineering at Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne ... When a molecule absorbs a photon, i.e., a particle of light, the absorption energy makes the molecule rotate faster, vibrate faster, or increases the energy of an outer shell electron. The changes in rotational rates, vibrational rates or modes, and/or the excitation of electrons are quantized, that is they can only rotate at discrete rotation rates, or vibrate at specific frequencies, or be excited from one well-defined energy level to another. The transition between specific rotation rates, vibrational frequencies, and energy levels corresponds to the wavelength or frequency of an absorption line. Each of these absorption mechanisms corresponds to a different energy regime. Low energy photons corresponding to microwave or millimeter wavelengths tend to excite molecular rotational modes. Moderate energy photons corresponding to infrared wavelengths tend to excite molecular vibrational modes. Therefore, it usually takes more energy to make a molecule vibrate than to rotate. Even higher energy photons corresponding to visible light tend to excite outer shell electrons from one energy level to a higher one. (I should note that even higher energy photons corresponding to ultraviolet light and x-rays can break molecular bonds causing molecules to break into their constituent molecules or atoms. I will ignore this mechanism because it is not relevant to a discussion of greenhouse gases.) Since greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation while being transparent to visible light, greenhouse gases tend to have one or more rotational or vibrational modes that can be excited by infrared light, that is, they can absorb infrared light at the specific frequency of a transition between different rotational or vibrational modes. In contrast, since greenhouse gases are transparent at visible wavelengths, these molecules do not have electron transitions that can be excited by photons corresponding to visible wavelengths. More on Quantization and Quantum Weirdness In the macroscopic, non-quantum world, a fidget spinner can be spun to rotate at any speed, and when they slow down their speed seems to decrease continuously. In contrast, consider a fidget spinner the size of a water molecule. Now quantum effects will be relevant. Assuming it was spinning at 1,000 rpm, a 1.0 centimeter-wavelength photon corresponding to the energy difference between the allowed 1,000 rpm rotation rate and the allowed 1,500 rpm rotation rate would cause the fidget spinner to suddenly and discontinuously change its speed from 1,000 rpm to 1,500 rpm. In contrast, a 1.1 centimeter-wavelength that did not correspond to the energy difference between the allowed rotation rates would not be absorbed by the fidget spinner and would instead pass right by. More on Greenhouse Gases Water Vapor The most prevalent greenhouse gas is water vapor, which is a polar molecule, that is, the oxygen side is more negatively charged than the hydrogen side, giving rise to a non-uniform electric field, denoted by the dipole moment vector in the diagram below. As the molecule rotates, its electric field rotates. Since the electric field rotation rates are quantized, photons that are at the right energy to cause the transition between water vapor rotational rates will be absorbed. The energy differences between the rotational modes give rise to a series of microwave and millimeter-wavelength absorption lines. The water molecule’s hydrogen molecules can also vibrate in synch towards and away from the oxygen atom, and similarly out of synch with each one alternately moving towards and away from the oxygen atom (as shown by the red arrows). The hydrogen atoms can also move towards each other and away from each other. Each of these vibrational modes corresponds to different sets of excitation energies giving rise to a plethora of absorption lines in the infrared. Carbon Dioxide Carbon dioxide is the second most potent greenhouse gas. It is a linear molecule and therefore does not have a dipole moment. The lack of a dipole moment means that there is no way to either determine its orientation in space or rotation rate. Therefore, carbon dioxide does not have any rotational modes and cannot absorb microwave or millimeter-wavelength photons. In contrast, carbon dioxide does have a series of vibrational modes corresponding to its oxygen molecules vibrating in synch towards and away from the central carbon atom, and similarly out of synch alternating towards and away from the central carbon atom (as shown by the red arrows). There are also bending vibrational modes as shown by the outer red arrows. Each of these vibrational modes corresponds to a different set of excitation energies yielding a thicket of absorption lines in the infrared. Similar analyses can be used to explain the spectrum of other greenhouse gases such as methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, and CFCs.

Ugx8gwGEhldo5cJFfFZ4AaABAg.8s9Vq6_7O7e8sC2UJBADDm		8	2019-03-08 00:27:54	Rick Kooi	@Marvin Martian Putting the word --"physics"-- before your belief does not make your belief, the truth ! . "The temperature of the earth is governed by physics, namely the Stefan-Boltzmann law which states that the amount of energy radiated is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. ERad = SB * Temp^4. Or Temp = (ERad/SB)^0.25 Where: SB, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is 5.670 x 10-8 Watt/meter^2 Kelvin^2 ERad, the amount of energy radiated to outer space in watts/meter^2. . For Earth at equilibrium, the amount of energy radiated should equal the amount of energy received from the sun. However, the Earth is not at equilibrium and is actually receiving slightly more energy that it is emitting. . This is why the earth is warming. . If the earth were in equilibrium, then the amount of energy being radiated would equal the amount received from the sun. That is ERad would be a constant and a function of average Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and albedo (a). ERad = TSI*(1- a)/4 TSI is 1365.5 Watts/meter^2 a, albedo which is 0.3 for Earth So, ERad is approximately 237 Watts/meter^2. . Putting this altogether yields an Earth Temperature of 254°K (-18°C or -1°F). This temperature corresponds to the atmospheres temperature at about 5 kilometers above the surface (16,000ft). It is at this elevation where the earth radiates to outer space approximately the same amount of energy it receives from the sun. . Temperatures at lower elevations are generally much warmer due to the greenhouse effect, which makes it difficult for the atmosphere to radiate infrared energy at lower elevations. In fact, greenhouse gases inhibit radiation to such an extent, that convection of heat is the dominate mechanism for transporting energy from the surface to elevations where it can be effectively radiated to outer space. . Keep in mind that the earth radiates primarily in the infrared which is the predominate wavelength at 254°K. Infrared is invisible to humans. . Anyhow, if there were no greenhouse gases, then earths surface temperature would become so cold that the oceans would freeze. . This in turn would raise the earths albedo and reflect more energy directly to outer space. In turn the Stefan-Boltzmann law would drive the temperature even colder and we would end up living on a giant snowball. . However, the earths atmosphere does have greenhouse gases. In particular CO2, which warms the atmosphere enough so that water can exist as a vapor. Since water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, together these greenhouse gases have warmed earths surface to about 287°K (14°C or 57°F). . While CO2 may comprise just a small fraction of the atmosphere, it behaves like a dye in that it absorbs infrared energy very well. Finally, the earths temperature is not in equilibrium. . The earth is absorbing about 1.5 watt/meter^2 more energy than it is emitting. . This in turn is warming the atmosphere, oceans, land, snow and ice. . By far, most of the extra heat is going into the oceans. The oceans have a tremendous capacity for storing heat and it will take a long time before they reach equilibrium. . When equilibrium is eventually reached, there will be more evaporation of water and the atmosphere will become thicker from increased amount of water vapor. . This will result in warmer surface temperatures and a higher elevation at which the earth can radiate to outer space. . I’m not the first person to figure this all out. In fact, an intergovernmental panel of climate change scientist (IPCC) have been studying this subject intently for well over 20 years. The IPCC has carefully reviewed many scientific studies and have published their latest assessment here: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/asse... What has been concluded (TS.4.5 on page 64) is that the earths temperature is sensitive to changes of CO2 concentration. In particular, equilibrium change is likely to be in the range 2°C to 4.5°C per doubling of CO2, with a best estimate value of about . . . .. . . . . . . . . . > 3°C < reference https://www.physicsforums.c...

IPCC Summary for Policymakers16SPMRural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world (high confidence). {2.3.2}Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing temperature (limited evidence, high agreement), but global economic impacts from climate change are currently difficult to estimate. From a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security and prolong existing and create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger (medium confi-dence). International dimensions such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of climate change at regional scales. {2.3.2}Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people (medium evidence, high agreement). Populations that lack the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme weather events, particularly in developing coun-tries with low income. Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks (medium confidence). {2.3.2}SPM 2.4 Climate change beyond 2100, irreversibility and abrupt changesMany aspects of climate change and associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. {2.4}	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	Ugx8gwGEhldo5cJFfFZ4AaABAg	xyzct

Moore is often incorrectly referred to as a founder of Greenpeace. According to a statement by Greenpeace, “Patrick Moore frequently portrays himself as a founder or co-founder of Greenpeace, and many news outlets have repeated this characterization. Although Mr. Moore played a significant role in Greenpeace Canada for several years, he did not found Greenpeace.” . After he left Greenpeace, Moore began work with the Nuclear Energy Institute front group, the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition (CASEnergy). Moore stepped down from his leadership role at CASEnergy in January 2013, however said he would remain an active member. [16], [38], [39], Moore has worked for the mining industry, the logging industry, PVC manufacturers, the nuclear industry, and in defense of biotechnology. Greenpeace issued a 2010 statement distancing itself from Moore, saying he “exploits long gone ties with Greenpeace to sell himself as a speaker and pro-corporate spokesperson, usually taking positions that Greenpeace opposes.” [5] Moore has been criticized for his relations with “polluters and clear-cutters” through his consultancy. His primary income since the early 1990s has been consulting and publicly speaking for a variety of corporations and lobby groups such as the Nuclear Energy Institute.

AOC said it and got 100 Congress people to sign on. I watched and heard her say it. And even if it's HALF of that, it's utter INSANITY. She has said, AND way too many agree, that we have 12 years before the planet is catastrophically, irrevocably damaged. People actually BELIEVE this garbage! And dire predictions like this create opportunities for legislators to do more insane things to "save us", which ALWAYS involves increased taxation. In CA it's worse than anywhere. Our representatives operate with a witch's brew of incredible incompetence, ignorance and greed. I have also to been listening to Patrick Moore, PHD in Ecology, (one of the founders of Green Peace), and he's a man who was on the front lines, VERY early in the ecology business. He was the ONLY one of 6 leaders of the organization with a scientific background. He and Green Peace did a lot of really good things way back when but it became a corrupt enterprise. He saw the morphing of activism for the good of people and watched as it degraded into propaganda based on a lot of ignorance; he saw the corruption as it grew and how Green Peace became a nutbag organization that was rife with corruption, FAR too much power and greed. He left. He also spoke about chlorine and how because Green Peace, in it's utter unscientific arrogance, forbid 3rd world countries from getting it, thus, millions died, needlessly. It is used in MANY medications and was used to fight and win over Cholera. It's antiseptic properties are essential to life on this planet. This idea that "chemicals" are bad is batsht crazy. Most of them are organic to begin with! He laughs about our C02 hysteria. He was talking about how in the last 400,000 years, we've had 4 ice ages of sorts, and that C02 got so low in one of them- below 200ppm and the earth could no longer sustain plant life. He says that the point of diminishing returns is over 2.000ppm and that we're only at 400- AND that it does not cause warming and the increased C02 is slowly GREENING the planet- enough to where crops are disposed of because of abundance. At LL THAT being said, (I suggest you seek him out and listen to him), you and I are on the same page- NO SUBSIDIES of any kind for power. Govt GET OUT and let the free market do what it always does. It's not perfect but is destroyed and corrupted when the govt gets involved. (-8 Oh and puleeeze, if you think "conservatives" are to blame here for all this bullsht, you need to get outside your bubble and first of all, understand that people are NOT a pox on the earth, (we are actually helping it in innumerable ways), and that "conservatives" are not the bulk of greedy bastards.. Wall Street was nearly all liberals and academia is all liberals, as is the media and Hollywood. THAT is where a HUGE amount of the money and power is.

NO 93 TRILLION dollar green new deal! And if we need coal plants for a while in certain areas, so be it. If the free market is making the green energy work and the govt will stay the eff out, I'm happy. In the meantime, there is no catastrophe and we're not going to be at some tipping point in 12 years. If govt is subsidizing coal, that needs to be corrected. And forget getting rid of oil for a very, very long time. We're not going to reinvent the wheel for some dunderheads that think the world is going to end in 12 years. Like I said, even IF we stopped driving internal combustion engines, we STILL need tons of oil until such time as we figure out what to make everything that's Petroleum based out of. Like this computer. AOC and 100 congress people have signed on to getting rid of cows, cars and planes with a 93 TRILLION dollar new deal. STOP IT! Somebody please fire that nutcase and allow the movement that's happening to do what it's doing. My point about taxes is just that. The New Deal is not necessary and in the meantime, we have to stop giving our politicians reasons to virtue signal with taxes to get us to green energy faster. It appears the better mouse trap has been built so, we'll slowly transfer over without causing HUGE economic and societal problems.

Then the THIEVING GOVT can keep their effing dirty hands OUT of it. 93 TRILLION dollars of tax money is NOT needed. Let the free market do it's thing and we won't have to pay a DIME in taxes. Somebody PLEASE tell Ms. Cortez and her 100 imbecile cronies that CAPITALISM takes care of humanity's problems and they can stuff it. Here in CA, we are taxed INSANELY for everything you can think of- they are trying to implement a tax on texts.. we already pay an "occupancy tax" just to get a room in a hotel.. on top of a zillion other taxes. The gas tax hikes never stop but the roads stay the same. We have a big, bloated albatross for a govt here in CA and ANY chance they have to virtue signal, (over unsettled science), to tax us, they JUMP on it. It's sickening. The last time the feds sunk gazillion dollars into solar companies, they all went bankrupt, thank you Obama. And WE NEED oil for the other 6,000 items we use every day so even if everyone goes with electric cars, we still need oil. A friend of mine just bought an electric car and finding charging stations that actually work is a joke and you need special circuitry installed in your home to charge it there. Again, WE'LL GET THERE! Sounds like some places are already there. RIGHT ON. But keep the govt the hell OUT of the way while investors take care of providing the new energy sources. And in the meantime I STILL don't truly believe in this God awful catastrophic C02 theory. According to the IPCC, humans make only 5% of the C02 in the atmosphere. The rest is natural. Keeping other coal toxins contained the best we can, (there IS no perfect world), until the infrastructure, etc., can be implemented by private industry, (after they get through the INSANE amounts of money for permits, licensing, and OMG.. I can't even begin to tell you how much the govt makes off all of this stuff... if they would BACK THE F OFF, these things could be done so much faster and cheaper. I actually think big govt is a HUGE threat to progress. You can't even open an ice cream shop here in CA without a lawyer and insane amounts of money for codes and regulations and permits and and and... to build an apartment building, there is basically a per- door knob tax... anyway, glad to hear the good news and now we gotta get the govt to do it's job and STAY OUT of this forward movement.

"...The solar and wind industries are each creating permanent WELL PAYING jobs at a rate 12 times faster than that of the rest of the U.S. economy, according to a new report. The study, published by the (EDF) Climate Corps program, says that high paying solar and wind jobs have grown at rates of about 20% annually in recent years, and sustainability now collectively represents four to four and a half million jobs in the U.S., up from 3.4 million in 2011...."

COAL is by far the most heavily Supported Energy Source in this country. Did you hear the OIL/Coal PR people on Fox Business whining about the extreme highest in the world taxes they are charged??? TOO FUNNY! They were quoting the Percent in the Tax law...never bothered to tell anyone...that not one of those companies have ever paid anything close to the book rate. Most Oil/Coal Companies pay between 3% and at most under 20% ! Some of the CHEAPEST TAX RATES IN THE WORLD. But that doesn't even begin to take into consideration the Subsidies and the Supports that do not effect the tax rates..... FREE Infrastructure Building and FREE Maintenance. ..like entire road systems, new fire stations just for the industry, free police patrols, free snow plowing FREE electric service ! ! ! !

And coal is only that expensive because of govt virtue signal / opportunism taxes, I'm sure, just like Petroleum. Again, I'm with everyone on green energy but it has to work on a large scale and we have to have a way to store it. I was recently reading about how the technology for storage IS improving and what will happen is that eventually, we will transition over to the newer technology, as it gets better. This is my entire point. Everyone getting all up in a froth about how we have to make some catastrophic changes now is just not realistic. Also, most people have no idea how much Petroleum they have in their lives, (and should be sincerely grateful for), so they have cockamamie ideas about the evils of oil. We are SO lucky to have oil!! And as long as we keep the engine of Capitalism running, there will always be entrepreneurs who will work on new ideas and will build a better mouse trap, so to speak. I also recently heard AOC say that she knows the Green New Deal is not feasible, (THANK you God for some sanity), so I'm less worried about the government implementing Draconian taxes and regulations. They are such nincompoops and thieves!!	UCG9RqMmHEd5GyJqABZV5g-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG9RqMmHEd5GyJqABZV5g-A	1	UgyBHH79wAn471noaYF4AaABAg	Crazyworld Larue

Better ways to contain toxic wastes are essential. We'll get there. Technology is improving all of the time. We've made huge messes in the past but we're getting better at doing what we do. I'm NOT going to freeze or die of heat stroke because of some toxins. Up until recently, when stress levels got higher and higher, we were living longer and longer each year. And what about Nuclear? France has been doing very well with it for a very long time. Yes, of course there are risks but there is NOTHING without risk and as technology and understanding improves, so do our methodologies for handling sources of power. I have NEVER said I don't want green energy. I want green energy that works on a large scale and doesn't make the poor even poorer. I hope we CAN come up with super efficient green energy sources very soon. In the meantime, people need jobs, they need to eat, they need to have access to reasonable temperatures, etc. PEOPLE ARE NOT A POX ON THE EARTH. There is no perfect world.

And I bet you are going to claim that $93 Trillion RIGHT WING GROTESQUE EXAGGERATION is all going to be paid out every year ? ? ? ? Tell us another Whopper ! Killer COAL ELECTRIC GENERATION: . Killer Coal Execs increase AUTOMATION to forestall the need to hire back employees, but the thousands of open air, Earth-Lined, TOXIC pits & ponds & old mine shafts. Used to store Coal Electric Generated TOXIC WASTES, without appropriate standards or supervision ! . Dumping Toxic Waste is the Cheapest Waste Disposal method. Every year in EACH of the nation’s CLEANEST Killer Coal ELECTRIC GENERATION plants produce 140 million tons of HIGHLY TOXIC COAL ASH WASTE / Year ------> the toxic by-product that is left over after the coal is burned and Smoke is Scrubbed. . THE CLEANEST COAL PLANT still produces MILLIONS of Tons of TOXIC Coal Ash / year. . All that ash has to go somewhere, so it’s dumped in the backyards of power plants across the nation —into earth lined open-air ponds/pits / precarious surface-waste pools. . Most of these sites lack ANY adequate safeguards, leaving nearby communities at risk from potential large-scale disasters like the massive coal ash spill in Tennessee in 2008 & from gradual yet equally dangerous contamination as coal ash toxins seep into drinking water Aquifers or are blown into nearby communities. . Coal ash pollution contains high levels of toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, selenium, lithium, other cancer-causing agents. . The public health hazards & environmental threats to nearby communities from unsafe coal ash dumping have been known for many DECADES, including increased risk of cancer, learning disabilities, neurological disorders, birth defects, reproductive failure, asthma (1 million new cases/yr.), and other illnesses. . Coal ash is not subject to federal supervision, and state laws governing coal combustion waste disposal are weak or nonexistent. . The result: TENS Millions of tons of TOXIC coal ash PRODUCED BY EACH COAL ELECTRIC PLANT are being stored in ponds, landfills, and abandoned mines...in 47 states. . TVA disaster in Tennessee in which a EARTHEN dike is holding back decades’ worth of coal ash failed at the Kingston Fossil Plant, flooding the surrounding residential area with more than one billion gallons of toxic coal ash —enough to flood more than 3,000 acres one foot deep. . While dramatic events like the coal ash spills in Tennessee garner national media attention, dangerous contaminants are quietly seeping from TOXIC killer coal ash dumps into groundwater supplies across the country or blowing into the air of communities, exposing people and wildlife to toxic substances. ...data indicates that at least 535REGISTERED SITES (nearly 2000 in 47 states) OPEN TOXIC coal ash ponds, pools, pits & old mine shafts! . KNOWN to operate without a simple liner to prevent dangerous chemicals and heavy metals from reaching drinking water sources. . The Hazards of Coal Ash FROM Electric Generation. Living near a wet coal ash storage pond is significantly more dangerous than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, according to a risk assessment done by the EPA. The toxins found in coal ash have been linked to organ disease, cancer, respiratory illness, neurological damage, and developmental problems. . People living within one mile of unlined coal ash ponds can have a 1 in 50 risk of cancer —more than 2,000 times higher than what the EPA considers acceptable. . Coal ash contains arsenic, lead, mercury, and selenium, as well as aluminum, barium, boron, and chlorine. All can be toxic. Particularly where there is prolonged exposure, these toxins can cause cancer, heart damage, lung disease, respiratory distress, kidney disease, reproductive problems, gastrointestinal illness, birth defects, impaired bone growth in children, and behavioral problems. . In short, coal ash toxics have the potential to injure all of the major organ systems in adults (including pregnant women) and children. Exposure to toxic coal ash can lower birth rates, cause tissue disease, slow development, and even kill plants and animals, leading to changes in wildlife concentrations and disruptions to entire ecosystems. . The toxic pollution from coal ash builds up in exposed animals and plants, causing pollution to make its way up the food chain when they are eaten. . Children are more susceptible to the health impacts of coal ash —and according to the EPA, 1.54 million children live near coal ash storage sites. . Not only is coal ash toxic, it is also likely to grow increasingly dangerous. . Air pollution control technologies, like SCRUBBERS, selective catalytic reduction, and activated carbon injection, capture mercury and other hazardous air pollutants and are able to stop increasing amounts of toxic pollution from going up the smokestacks. . However, when those pollutants are captured they are shifted from the air to the TOXIC coal ash. . Mercury and other TOXIC pollutants that previously contributed to air pollution are now becoming solid wastes —they leach into water, their toxicity is carried into the water as well. ..." .

Anyone who doesn't know we need cleaner ways to produce power- most companies have already implemented cleaner methodologies long ago, has been in a coma for 50 years. OK so, put solar panels on your roof and do your thing. Making solar panels creates toxic waste and use energy to produce. SLOW DOWN everyone. We will get there. We've made changes in the past and we're still making them and we will continue to make them. And by the way, nature does some pretty nasty stuff, itself but of course, you'd have to know people who work in national parks and many other outdoor occupations to get a read on it.

I have yet to hear a good explanation at what caused the Medieval Warm Period, the Cooling in the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and all of the other climate swings pre-industrial. That said we really do need to clean up our act as a global species. We need clean energy sources. Renewables are fine but I don&#39;t think they are the answer totally. We really need practical fusion power.	UCcn7Bzj5lkfpoYhEObsHF-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn7Bzj5lkfpoYhEObsHF-A	0

Human-caused climate change is not “defined” as the part of climate change which is not natural, it is defined as climate change which is caused by humans.<br /><br />Why is this important, if the two are actually the same?<br />It is important because we have clear and well-investigated physical models for how the anthropogenic part works (for both greenhouse- and aerosol contributions), and can thus calculate how strong they are <i>without</i> needing to know anything about the natural parts. If then the measured temperatures agree with the projections from those models (which they broadly do, though not perfectly), then this is good indication that the natural factors are indeed <i>weaker</i> than the anthopogenic ones, as expected.<br />This matches the historical record from ice cores etc., which shows that climate change in the past has been, though not <i>weaker</i> than today, generally much <i>slower.</i><br /><br />That doesn&#39;t mean natural factors are not important – they&#39;re well worth examining. However the physics of all those other natural forcings mentioned in the video are much less clear-cut than the rock-solid greenhouse effect, and some of them are outright esoteric. If you can give a proper quantitative estimate for the strength of them, great! But it would be very surprising if any of them came close to the strength of orbital forcing and greenhouse, if only because of the historical record with strongly suggests that long-term climate (over the phanerozoic) has been governed by a combination of TSI and CO₂, and the mid-term climate (over the quaternary) has been governed by the Milankovitch cycles with amplification through CO₂. We can&#39;t <i>count out</i> that other drivers have also had significant influence, but we also don&#39;t really have any indication of that. But if you do have such indication, give references!

I guess what you mean is “no study has directly calculated the influence of anthropogenic CO₂, but instead all have calculated the influence of natural factors and subtracted that from the observed warming”. However, _that_ is completely false: _most_ studies in this subject has set out by directly calculating the greenhouse & aerosol effect – starting with the very first estimations in the 19th century, getting quantitative with GCMs in the 1960s-70s, and continuing. I'm not completely firm with the details of the current models; it certainly seems to be true that these use empirical forcing inputs in addition to laboratory-derived physics. But still that doesn't mean they're invalidated by the effects discussed in this video: even if those effects do contribute significantly, the historical record suggests that it's confined to the short-term timescale. So over longer time, we should still expect the anthropogenic greenhouse effect to dominate. If you claim otherwise, formulate proper physical models for the effects you reckon important, quantify their influence, and match it with the historical record to confirm the correlation. And then explain why the greenhouse contribution does not also stack onto that.

They take this data and compare it to today&#39;s readings taken digitałly every 0.01 seconds (all day), and in 0.001 degree increments! In addition, some of the weather station locations have moved many miles. Chicago&#39;s readings were first taken next to the lake in the 1800&#39;s. Then it moved to Midway airport 10 miles southwest until @ 1985. Now it&#39;s at O&#39;Hare @ 15 miles nw of Midway. Ałl of these locations are microclimates. One next to a very large body of water, Midway is a heat island in the city, and O&#39;Hare is near open areas and prairie but also industry and vast amounts of cement.

European science agencies were paying ships to periodically drop a bucked 20 ft into the sea, bring up the water, and measure the temperature, accurate to a tenth of a degree Fahrenheit. Weather stations set across the globe were measuring all manner of variables. Temperature, CO2, O2, rainfall, cloud cover, sun temperature, wind speed and direction, and more. We got more precise (more decimal places known), but we didn't get more accurate. And then the modern 'scientists' feel the need to go back and 'adjust' those measurements from 150 years ago.

Changes in parameters of chaotic systems do not have effects proportional to intensity. To the contrary, a given change in input parameter may cause the output to move in one direction, and a larger change may cause it to move in the OPPOSITE direction. This is called non-monotonicity. Changes in chaotic systems produces alterations of orbits. What is an orbit. It is a zone of similar states which have similar parameters. For example: The non-ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) orbit of climate in Earth is the way thing usually are. When perturbations, for whatever reason, switch the orbit to ENSO mode flipping the circulation of air and water around the Earth to a different pattern.<br /><br />Not making mathematical errors is meaningless here. ALL climate models make simplifying assumptions that reduce the complexity of the Mathematics by dozens of powers of ten. They all used crude approximations. The temperature, pressure, humidity in a single &quot;cell&quot; of cubic kilometers represents the far more complex reality of temperature, pressure, humidity of each parcel of air. Mathematical errors are not the issue at all. The issue is &quot;How valid is the approximation being used?&quot; The answer is invariably, &quot;Not Very&quot;.

With every exhale, you are polluting and increasing global warming. Personally, we need more CO2! Trees are starving for CO2. CO2 and Carbon are the Ultimate Renewable Energy Resource. You breathe O2 and produce CO2. Plants breathe CO2 and produce O2. However, since most of the CO2 is absorbed by the Oceans, that CO2 is used by two classes of lifeforms...Plankton who like other plants breathe in the CO2 and Produce O2, and the Crustaceans who convert CO2 into their shells in the form of Calcium Carbide. When Crustaceans die, they fall to the ocean bottom and that carbon is for all intents and purposes permanently sequestered.<br /><br />On land, as carbon based lifeforms die and decompose, much of the debris can be utilized as plant food, however, that decomposition also produces CO2. As the decomposing debris, settles on the ground, the earth builds up layers then in a few million years, veins of Coal are produced as well as pools of oil. When &quot;man&quot; digs out this coal and oil and burns it, he is simply returning that sequestered carbon back into the carbon cycle of life!<br /><br />Horticulturalists will increase the CO2 levels in their greenhouses to 1100 ppm. This is 700 ppm higher than what we see in nature at this time. Why would they do this? ...because it&#39;s good for the plants!!! Plants get greener and produce more numerous and more colorful blooms. Food production is increased as well! ...and all with the benefit of needing less water!<br /><br />Those of you who believe that the earth will die in 12 years unless we immediately change our habits, please come back in 12 years so you can tell me how stupid I was for wanting more CO2...OR...I can tell you how stupid YOU were for making &quot;climate change&quot; your religion.<br /><br />More CO2 is good! Less CO2 is bad! If you somehow manage to drive CO2 down to 150 ppm, all the plants will suffocate and die. ...followed by all animal life that requires O2 to live and and plant matter to consume for nourishment. You are foolishly allowing politics to control your future. This entire movement is a means by the left to gain another measure of control over the populace! Once you give up your liberties, it&#39;s nearly impossible to get them back without a revolution and/or major bloodshed!<br /><br />Man&#39;s job is to return sequestered Carbon back into the Carbon Life Cycle by burning it! Man needs energy...plants need CO2. Man needs O2...plants provide O2 in return for man providing CO2. Man needs food...plants provide food in return for man providing CO2! We live on a planet that has symbiotic relationships. If you&#39;re concerned about too much CO2, go plant some trees! Plant some Corn or Tomato Plants. ...and don&#39;t feel so bad about exhaling CO2! Plants will love you for it!!!	UCpmrpOMOa6S9uvsFdBQ1TWQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpmrpOMOa6S9uvsFdBQ1TWQ	0

So if you did one million measurements a day, every day for a year, you'd have one surface measurement per square kilometer of ocean surface for the whole year, let alone any depth measurements. You think one measurement per square kilometer per year is representative?	UCFeq2E--r9iaHLLlO361XFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFeq2E--r9iaHLLlO361XFg	1	UgwQeEGqKGlt4by-DfJ4AaABAg	Lee Fwentez

One time it was reported, that the northern jet-stream meandered so much, that it even crossed the equator. Unheard of, before, and unexplainable by standard meteorology!

Where are the calculations, the numbers, the models he mentioned? Also, climate is not just heat or warming/cooling and btw including particle forcing wont change much at all, as it is like adding a constant to an equation. If you apply it to current sets of data, you also have to apply it to the whole timeline (history). You graphs may go up or down as a whole, but it wouldn&#39;t change the observable trend.

You are talking for 40 minutes and the main takeaway from your speech is: "putting medium energy electrons into the equations of CMIP6 adds more energy into the system than the effect of rising CO2 levels could ever do" - and you are saying that adding ONLY those electrons does not give the whole picture because other sources are still missing. By the way "putting medium energy electrons into the equation and crunching the numbers" is the only line that can be considered as YOUR work. In essence, you claim that particle forcing, if properly added, contributes at least for as much energy input as rising CO2 levels but probably much more. Which in return means what, that the temperatures should actually be higher and "something" is providing cooling? The history of the world has seen higher CO2 levels and higher temperatures as we have now, but it never has seen a faster change than what we experience now, beside natural disasters. Usually we are talking about millennia, but now its more a matter of decades or centuries. The one thing that changed is the presense of humans. Sorry man, but the energy input from cosmic radiation and the sun, that you claim are the main reasons for the current warming, exist for a couple of billion years but there is not a single record I know of that shows such rapid rising in CO2 levels in the past 800 000 years. Unless you provide some solid numbers and models (perhaps of your of own?) for the effect of particle forcing, I'd would not put asside the possiblity of anthropogenic climate change and you yourself admit that it is difficult to say what effects particle forcing actually has.

The top 20 warmest global annual temperature averages have all occurred within the last 22 years. So much for global cooling or Solar forcing variations etc. Couple this with the reality that humanity has emitted more C02 in the last 25 years than its entire prior existence as a civilization and yeah.... we have a problem regardless of what this individual or group or any other group has to say about it. Green house gassing the planet from C02 is as obvious as the reason why the Arctic ice caps are warming faster than any other region of the Earth. We think for example, that 1.1 degrees global average isn&#39;t much but... temperatures are 3x warmer on land than on sea (71% area of earths surface is water). Couple this fact with temperatures warming 2x more in temperate latitudes and 3x more in high latitudes and up to 4x more than the arctic poles and we see Green house gassing on steroids. Why? The trajectory of light from the summer sun is around +70 degrees near the equator at mid day. In the Arctic, its around 20 degrees or less meaning the light has to go through 3 to 4 times the atmospheric thickness to get to the surface and if reflected, bounce back out ping ponging through that much more GHG&#39;s along the way heating the Arctic much like a convection oven. To say that the science of GHG&#39;s isn&#39;t sound or Global warming is not happening considering why the Arctic is warming so much faster than the rest of the world is beyond lame. I just explained it to the point where the mind of a child can understand, ok, maybe adolescent but you all get my point. Its not difficult to understand and if it is that simple to understand, why do people get it wrong? Scientists are poor public speakers. They tend to get lost in their detail and the rest... they like to make shit up for money, to sound smarter than everyone else, a mental health condition perhaps, whatever, liars and false truthers are common and they will get their reward along with those who believe them.

Cook a freelance Cartoonist. Even the scientific papers used to construct this narrative have been rebuked as valid conclusions by the scientists who wrote the papers. Most of them state that their papers and studies weren&#39;t even climate driven....As for science one needs only look into ice core samples to realize how not concerning these things are. As far as co2 and harmful chemicals to the ozone, One needs only to look into the out put of volcanic eruptions. Climate change is a fear monger political coo to usurp rights.

I have always believed that the taxable CO2 model is a lie for money and that &quot;pollution&quot; is what they should focus on. Also, if CO2 really were to blame, then wouldn&#39;t companies like soft-drinks and fizzy drinks, beer industries and CO2 fire extinguisher companies all be taxed a hell of a lot more?

Like I said; economies created by white colonization. S.Africa like Zimbabwe is taking the jobs and infrastructure control away from the whites who buit it. Have you SEEN Zimbabwe and S. Africa lately? Not a few people, the society as a collective is what I'm talking about. _"EGYPT?"_ Did you miss my post relating to the 2016 articles showing the most accurate DNA testing of ancient mummy DNA showing 0% Sub-Saharan African DNA? 0%? God gave you two ears and one mouth.... _"America when we first settled here..."_ Did you ever read writings and journals from English travelers and sojourners that explored early colonial America before the revolution? The one big marvel was the lack of general poverty, and the relative wealth and health of even the most common of citizens. Yes, shareholder capitalism, trusts and monopolies created some pretty nasty conditions. They exploited a lot of immigrants who were very use to poverty, and lowered the national living wages and standards (supply and demand). It gave us the Scofield mine indecent, the triangle shirt-waste fire and many-many more immigrant-fueled, low wage abuses for greed. But it was also good Americans that rose to mogul status that gave us Stakeholder Capitalism and broke the trusts and monopolies, shifting the working poor class to middle class status, and gave us the greatest period of economic growth the world has ever known. It was an industrial revolution based on the people and the community, not just CEOs and shareholders, and the world followed our lead. Sadly, we've reverted to shareholder capitalism, not because stakeholder capitalism failed, but because it made the common man too powerful, too wealthy. The elite don't like to share. That's a very different thing to not having the ability to innovate in the first place. No car company began in an African garage, nor computer company in an African garage. The military studies IQ for a very good reason. You might want to study the importance of these averages in society as well.

Unfortunately, in many other parts there has never been a functioning government- only wholly corrupt dictators & warlords. No functional educational system or infrastructure. So put your ignorance and nasty assed racism aside for 3-1/2 seconds and extrapolate through my last two sentences with industrialization and modernization in mind and think about what can and will happen in many places, given time. And what do you think America was when we first settled here? Aside from the rich founders and their associates, most people were dumb as dirt and lived on the equivalent of $1.00 a day, in today's terms. We are a miracle in terms of making something out of nothing in an incredibly intelligent way- of course with the advantage of building on the knowledge of the rich settlers who set up our government and industries here, in an astonishingly short period of time- rather like Israel but, enough already.

I also have a problem with the way the Chinese gov. subsidizes their industry so their companies can dump product well below cost in an attempt to monopolize a market segment. Then we have moron globalists that cry "foul; anti-free trade" if you try and punish the dumping by China. Then the Marxists want a green new deal and tax to death the west, but the worst polluters are left to save all the costs of ecology for profit, while the west goes farther and farther in debt and individual poverty. My dad was just a guy on the factory floor in 1970, adjusted for inflation, made $120k in today's money. How many factory workers make anywhere close to that? He was a tax payer, a saver, a spender, a jobs creator and a political force to be reckoned with. His modern peers are mostly now tax beneficiaries, impoverished, own nothing outright and in debt up to their eyeballs. They have no power, economically or politically. That's been the change from Stakeholder to Shareholder capitalism that's given Asia dominance over the west; by design. Yes. I have a problem with that. The military needs to get men trained fast in time of war, so they need to know who can be made productive quickly, and who can't. It's just that simple. They've found through intense scientific study, that anyone with an IQ of 85 or lower is of no values. They can't be trained at all let alone quickly to do most of the jobs required. The avg IQ in sub-saharan Africa is between 55-65. The black average IQ in the US is 85, that means most blacks in the US are capable of little else than surviving on welfare. You look at the transition in big cities and the transfer of peoples during "Urban flight", and you'll see an often repeated process of higher IQ working class people (including blacks) that moved to the suburbs, leaving the inner cities of many cities in America vacant. These spaces were filled mostly with the lower IQ masses that did not work and could not work or hold down jobs. Everything that's happened in Detroit, St. Louis, Baltimore and on and on, is a direct result of this phenomena. Study it. You don't even need to have the IQ issue front and center in the data you review. It's quite apparent what the force factors are that facilitate the same result every time. They like to blame slavery for their plight, but their condition is repeated globally, with similar results all over the world to the US, where no black has ever been a slave. Yet like 200 years ago, there's one place on earth where you can go and buy another human being, a black man for a slave; in Africa, in Libya. Put $400 American in your pocket, and you can own one yourself. Today. Nothing's changed there for thousands of years. The propensity to physical prowess and the combination of low IQ has made them the slave of choice for millennia. That's just the way it is. That's factual history, not guessing by the way, and if you think that's "racist", then ask yourself this: Why do 6% of the US population represent over 74% of the athletes in college and professional sports? Are they all racist in favor of blacks? or are they just naturally better? ANd if they can be better physically, isn't it also possibly that another race can also be better mentally?

The man who started the weather channel and many scientists who have worked in the field for many years have explained it clearly. So has the original co-founder of Green Peace. Many won't speak out for fear of retribution and the retribution is no small matter. Look up what happened to a scientist who disagreed that fat posed the highest health risk- he dared to think it was sugar. He was defunded, fired and ostracized. And go look at all the articles by world renowned scientists who made proclamation and predictions from the 1800's through the 2000's. DEAD wrong on most of their statements. The scientists of today are either honest believers who are only working the the present data provided or, don't 'want to be wrong, or, don't want to be defunded. Do your own research. I've been reading, watching and listening for 20 years and I also have critical thinking ability as well as the ability to extrapolate, within reason. The science they are pedaling now is not reasonable, it's been predicted before and it never, EVER happens. You do know that the Maldives are supposed to be submerged by now, right? You do know that a renowned scientist predicted we'd be ice free in the Arctic in 10 years.. that was in 1950. You do know that when C02 was at 300ppm we had the highest temperatures on record that lasted a few years in the 30's. We also had some of the worst storms, floods, hurricanes, droughts, on and on. NOBODY needs to be a scientist to look at 100 years of predictions that are ALL WRONG to strongly suspect that there's an agenda behind the crap they are pedaling now. Just watch this video. It isn't somebody's opinion- it's newspaper clippings of scientific statements from the 1800's through like 2010 or so. I don't care what you think of the person who made the video, READ what was written by "renowned scientists". That's all you really need to know. OH and maybe the fact that Germany went 100% green at a gigantic cost to the citizens and it failed miserably, resulting in actually producing more C02 than if they had just left the coal plants in operation. When green tech is efficient enough, we'll use it. For now, it's unbelievably foolish. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFlsJ1o3fVc&t=933s	UCG9RqMmHEd5GyJqABZV5g-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG9RqMmHEd5GyJqABZV5g-A	1	UgyWEDUPsvRZIT8uGfR4AaABAg	DerbJd

Continued uncontrolled 3rd world immigration in combination with the rise of autonomy is going to give ALL but the very elite of a a first hand look at that. Nor does it fully explain WHY they've been that way FOREVER. Africa; all but northern portions not controlled by Sub-Saharan Africans, have never in the history of humanity had a successful civilization. Ever. When one is built for them via colonization, quite successful economies and these Sub-Saharan Africans take it over as they have in Zimbabwe and are doing now in S. Africa, they not only can't create, but can't even keep the success established continuing. There's a distinct reason for that, and it's all about IQ there. Due to the newest, latest and greatest DNA technology and testing done in 2016 on ancient Egyptian mummies, differentiating BC mummies, the pyramid building mummies from later 1st and 2nd century AD mummies, we know know for example there is 0% Sub-Saharan African DNA in BC mummies. 0%. They were white, not black. Even the prophet Mohammed is described in the Hadith as being VERY, VERY White. In fact, to say otherwise for centuries was a head-separating offence. So this level of poverty is as much to do with who these people are and what they're capable of ON AVERAGE than anything else. That's not the issue, though that's the reason they're being pressed like cattle into Europe and previous commonwealth nations like the US, Canada and elsewhere; lower IQ people are easier to control and manipulate. The Calhoun study works much better with humans containing IQs closer to rats than the Asians or those who created the classics and many other great innovations. That's why London was a minority majority in 2011, and EVERY EUROPEAN NATION will be a white MINORITY within the next 20 years or so. By design.

Stand in front of a mirror and imagine yourself 50lbs lighter from starvation and dehydration. The dehydration makes you look 30 years older and your eyes are bulging out of your head because of it. You have old, torn up clothing, no shoes and you live in a hut with dirt floors. Right now the floor is still wet because there was a little rain a few days ago and your roof leaked. You're thirsty but you're afraid to go to the water in the area to drink because the last time, you had diarrhea for 4 days and you were so sick you couldn't move or eat. Your 5 year old sister died of Cholera a month ago. Your mom is so sick she can't get out of bed. You have to travel by foot with no shoes to see if you can find some bread to eat. You're exhausted because it was so cold last night that you couldn't sleep. SOLUTION? Industrialization. It creates jobs. Yes, you will pollute the hell out of the air for a while but then when the GDP of your country reaches high enough, like the USA did, you'll start implementing technologies to clear the air and water, (that is MUCH more abundant now because industry has built waterways and water treatment plants). Your dad and your brother have jobs now so your family was able to install a little bit indoor plumbing. Now you don't have to go behind that horrible hill and defecate into a hole in the ground, where are the flies are that carry typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, poliomyelitis, yaws, anthrax, tularemia, leprosy and tuberculosis. You have shoes now- they don't fit very well but your feet are healing up. Next week, your parents are going to buy a used refrigerator. It's beat up and doesn't get as cold as it should but it's better than no refrigerator at all. Green technology is NOT efficient enough to implement anywhere, on a large scale, right now. It is utterly EVIL to try to stop China and India from using coal and what ever it takes to bring them out of the most ghastly poverty you could ever imagine. And by the way, people are NOT a pox on the earth. People ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY SHOULD be alive and thriving on this planet, which by the way, IS DOING FINE. There are problems but we always take care of them and in addition, the planet takes care of all kinds of things, all by itself. One small example- since we stopped burning wood to stay alive, there are now more trees in the northern hemisphere than there were 100 years ago. They produce oxygen. You can extrapolate from there, I'm sure.	UCG9RqMmHEd5GyJqABZV5g-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG9RqMmHEd5GyJqABZV5g-A	1	UgyWEDUPsvRZIT8uGfR4AaABAg	DerbJd

The ones who aren't just don't know any better, yet. Ego and competition play a HUGE roll here. How many "we made a mistake, so sorry" papers have you seen written by the scientists who's theories have been 100% dead wrong, over the years? ZERO. And they are wrong ALL the time. (and by the way, if they AREN'T wrong quite often, it can't be called science). Look back at newspaper clippings of science proclamations and predictions from the 1800's to the 2000's about climate and you'll see gazillions of ridiculously wrong statements and predictions. Anybody heard or read any of those same scientists talking about how they made errors and have now come to different conclusions? Nope. And, there are consequences within the institutions they work for, if they admit being wrong- it makes the university look bad! And Yeah, let's burn wood!! Because right now, there are more trees in the northern hemisphere than there have been in 100 years. By the way, you can also look back at the ghastly storms, highest heat on record for about 3 or 4 years in the 1930's, insanely horrible blizzards, huge floods, 2/3 of the US in a terrible, long drought, (the dust bowl- you can read grapes of wrath), and so much more and this was all when when C02 was at 300ppm. The arctic was predicted to be ice free in 10 years by a renowned scientist in the 1950's. In the 70's, it was predicted that we would turn into vapor from heat. Then later in the 70's it was repeatedly predicted that there was an ice age coming, so horrible that humanity would starve to death. In the 2000's it was predicted we'd die of thirst and that the Maldives would be completely submerged by 2018. On and on. A scientist that worked for Obama wanted to put something awful in the water in Africa to keep the population down. And just so you know for sure, these were not single predictions made once or twice. It was repeated over and over. That's my 2 cents for now, I've got to leave for work.

If you want a hint into their future plan, lookup and research the Georgia Guidestones; the new 10 commandments of the New World Order. Pay special attention to the 1st commandment. Most don't understand that the coming autonomy WILL cause the displacement of most, eventually all carbon-based human life forms. It's pretty conservatively estimated that globally, 60% of the earth's jobs are to be made fully autonomous by 2035. That means any remaining jobs due to the availability of labor will be near worthless paywise. The elite like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Cuban and others are talking about a "global living wage" for all the billions of humans without the possibility of work, but when have you known the rich to just "GIVE" their money away en-mass to people who aren't contributing to society? THEY DON'T. I believe they WILL institute a GLW for a time, but once they own you; once your existence is dependent on their benevolence, they will cut us off. They already know the violence and chaos is coming, do you remember reading about the number of wealthy buying a rash of obscure remote shelters a couple years ago? They're prepping for a reason..... Study Dr. Calhoun's many experiments with rats and mice. There's a good video on YT called "Down the Rabbit Hole". It's around 24 minutes. The NIMH funded the research to the hilt. The results ended up having NOTHING to do with the original purpose, but if you watch closely, you'll see the environment is already being created, and we are mirroring the early stages of the experiment, which 100% of the time resulted in 100% violent devolution and loss of the entire colony. No variation Calhoun tried could save it. Nor could pre-rescued survivors, permanently mentally scarred by the environment survive when placed back in normal , healthy colonies. The "beautiful ones" stayed above the fray and isolated themselves from the melee. Once everything is virtualized and singularity AGI is realized and ubiquitous, the elite beautiful ones will have their desired immortality with an autonomous society. At least, that's the plan...... The excuse to sooth their conscience and allow people to be placed voluntarily in our "colonies" is and will be, "doing our 'bit' for climate change". It's all a tool to control the "useful idiots" to manipulate them and ultimately eliminate them once they're no longer needed. That's what this is all about....

You really can't see how burning fossil fuels releases CO2 much faster than plants can now reclaim it? It takes a lot of plant material to make a small amount of coal or oil. This is why there aren't many wood burning cars. Wood is much too bulky to be practical. It's taken geologic time scales to convert all this plant material into fossil fuels. We're burning this fuel much faster than it's being created. It amazes me there can be so many people who think burning coal and oil on industrial scales won't effect the planet in a significant way. I don't trust the liberal government to come up with a good plan to fight climate change but it really saddens me how many fellow conservatives think anthropogenic climate change isn't a thing. I'd much rather that conservative were involved with deciding what changes need to be made rather than leaving it up to liberals. Do any of you who think scientists are lying about climate change have science degree?

And keeping 3rd world countries from their industrial revolutions, which will for a while, cause more pollution, is evil and despicable. Once their GDP gets high enough, they'll start implementing things like we did in the 60's and 70's that cleared up our air. I live in CA so maybe I see it differently- if you were to see the number of ridiculous taxes we pay and hear the calls for more taxes on THE most ridiculous things you can imagine... we ARE the leader in the "green" movement... except for the fact that the overpopulated government here doesn't EVER do what they demand that we do... you might see it through the lens of taxes a bit more. But San Fran Nancy Pelosi has NEVER met a tax she didn't swoon over and she will do ANYTHING to get more money. President Trump said recently, "we have more money than we know what to do with". What president have you ever heard say something like that? And it's true! They have BILLIONS sitting in accounts doing nothing, they are paying BILLIONS in old programs that we no longer use and they are stealing BILLIONS in pay, perks, pension, free healthcare, limousines, drivers, armed guards, "conferences" in exotic locations at 5 star hotels...

UgyPj7B-KmVQZXQf_AZ4AaABAg	10	3	2019-03-05 13:04:40	Rick Kooi	&quot;....summary of 10 direct, measured lines of empirical evidence that point to human-induced climate change. <br /><br />In some cases, I have added layman&#39;s references in addition to the more rigorous citations <br /><br />Burning Fossil Fuels Correlates with Rising CO2. <br /><br />Humans are currently emitting around 30 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (CDIAC(ornl.gov)). <br /><br />Human Activities produce 100+ times MORE CO2 than all of the Volcanoes on Earth <br />Combined, <br />EVERY YEAR!<br /><br />( 0.3 billions tons by volcanoes versus 30 billion tons by mankind.)<br /><br />Of course,<br />it could be coincidence that CO2 levels are rising so sharply at the same time so let&#39;s look at more evidence that we&#39;re responsible for the rise in CO2 levels.<br />.<br />The proportion of Carbon-12 is increasing. (a distinct Burning-Fossil-Fuel isotope)<br />.<br />When we measure the type of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere, we observe more of the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels (Manning 2006 (noaa.gov)). <br /><br />[Blog explanation:<br />How do we know that recent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases are due to human activities? (realclimate.org)]<br />.<br />Oxygen Levels Dropping. <br />This is corroborated by measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere. (at over 100 locations world wide)<br />.<br />Oxygen levels are falling <br />in line with the amount of carbon dioxide rising, just as you&#39;d expect from fossil fuel burning which takes oxygen out of the air to create carbon dioxide (Manning 2006 (noaa.gov)).<br />.<br />Coral Also Confirms They&#39;re Fossil Carbons. <br />Further independent evidence that humans are raising CO2 levels comes from measurements of carbon found in coral records going back several centuries. <br /><br />These find a recent sharp rise in the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels ( Pelejero 2005 (sciencemag.org)).<br />.<br />More Heat is Being Trapped at CO2&#39;s Wavelength. <br />So we know humans are raising CO2 levels. <br /><br />What&#39;s the effect? <br />Multiple Satellites (multiple nations) measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding &quot;direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth&#39;s greenhouse effect&quot;. <br />.<br />(Harries 2001 (nature.com), <br />(Griggs 2004 (aip.org),<br />(Chen 2007 (eumetsat.eu)).<br />.<br />More Downward Infrared Radiation. <br />.<br />If less heat is escaping to space, <br />&gt; &gt; where is it going? <br />.<br />MUCH of it is Back to the Earth&#39;s surface.<br />Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation <br />(Philipona 2004 (agu.org), <br />(Wang 2009 (agu.org)). <br />.<br />A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that<br /><br />&quot;this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.&quot; <br />(Evans 2006 (confex.com)).<br />.<br />It&#39;s Not the Sun<br /> If an increased greenhouse effect is causing global warming, we should see certain patterns in the warming. <br /><br />For example, <br />the planet should warm faster at night than during the day. <br />This is indeed being observed (Braganza 2004 (sjsu.edu), Alexander 2006 (knmi.nl)).<br /><br />[Blog explanation: <br />Human Fingerprint on Climate Change: <br /><br />Nights warming faster than days (skepticalscience.com)]<br />and <br />the Stratosphere <br />is Cooling Since the Heat Is Being Trapped in the Troposphere.<br />.<br />Another distinctive pattern of greenhouse warming is cooling in the upper atmosphere, otherwise known as the stratosphere. <br />.<br />This is exactly what&#39;s happening (Jones 2003 (agu.org)).<br />.<br />The Tropopause is Rising. <br />With the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) warming and the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) cooling, another consequence is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, otherwise known as the tropopause, <br />should rise as a consequence of greenhouse warming. <br />.<br />This has been observed (Santer 2003 (nyu.edu)).<br />.<br />The Ionosphere is Contracting. <br />An even higher layer of the atmosphere, the ionosphere, is expected to cool and contract in response to greenhouse warming. <br /><br />This has been observed by satellites (Laštovi?ka 2006 (cas.cz)).<br />.<br />In addition to the 10 indicators proposed by Skeptical Science, there are many other empirically demonstrated lines of evidence for the rapid warming the earth is undergoing that should also be considered. <br />.<br />Here are two such items.<br />.<br />11) Species are headed to the poles and/or higher elevations. According to published research in the journal Science from August 2011, species are heading toward the poles and/or higher elevations. <br />(Source: Rapid Range Shifts of Species Associated with High Levels of Climate Warming)<br /><br />(The Lowly Pine Beetle, confined by COLD Temps. for millennia, to FAR Southern Latitudes … is now found routinely north of Fairbanks Alaska and across near Artic Canada. <br />.<br />Canadian Forestry Officials complain that this beetle NOW fells more Lodgepole Pines than Logging &amp; Forest Fires Combined.)<br />.<br />12) Plants are blooming far earlier each year. <br />NASA research supports this (Source: Decades of Data Show Spring Advancing Faster Than Experiments Suggest) as well as a 2011 University of California-San Diego study of Arctic blooms of photoplankton <br /><br />(Source: Researchers discover arctic blooms occurring earlier)<br /><br />Finally, I leave you two excellent data points to consider:<br /><br />Wide Spread Scientific Agreement.<br />(1) Scientific Consensus.<br />No scientific organization of national or international standing opposes the Widespread SHARED UNDERSTANDING (consensus} regarding human-induced effects on climate change.<br />(Source: Scientific opinion on climate change) <br />.<br />For those who may allege conspiracy, <br />consider the sheer number and diversity of the organizations listed here, representing diverse scientific backgrounds from Western and non-Western nations alike. <br />.<br />(Besides, if this were a conspiracy, how did they get plants and animals to collude?<br /> For That Matter, how did they get Muslims and Jews and Christians to agree)<br /><br />(2) Independent Analyses and Converted Skeptics: <br />In 2012, a Berkeley physicist completed an independent research project, funded in part by fossil fuel billionaires <br />(the Koch brothers), to evaluate raw global temperature data and come to its own conclusions. <br />The result? <br />The Conversion of a Climate-Change Skeptic<br /><br />The ASTRONOMIC COSTs of doing Nothing about Global Warming<br /><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/if-you-think-fighting-climate-change-will-be-expensive-calculate-the-cost-of-letting-it-happen">https://hbr.org/2017/06/if-you-think-fighting-climate-change-will-be-expensive-calculate-the-cost-of-letting-it-happen</a><br />.<br /><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/">https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/</a>	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	0

He used previous studies by Josef Stefan, Arvid Gustaf Högbom, Samuel Langley, Leon Teisserenc de Bort, Knut Angstrom, Alexander Buchan, Luigi De Marchi, Joseph Fourier, C.S.M. Pouillet, and John Tyndall.[13] 1895 — Sewage cleanup in London means the return of some fish species (grilse, whitebait, flounder, eel, smelt) to the River Thames. . 1860 — Henry David Thoreau delivers an address to the Middlesex (Massachusetts) Agricultural Society, entitled "The Succession of Forest Trees," in which he analyzes aspects of what later came to be understood as forest ecology and urges farmers to plant trees in natural patterns of succession; the address is later published in (among other places) Excursions, becoming perhaps his most influential ecological contribution to conservationist thought. .

Dec 16, 2017 · So when an anticyclone caused cold air to stagnate over London, the sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and smoke particles mounted — and ended up choking as many as 12,000 people to death. . The 1948 Donora smog was a historic air inversion that resulted in a wall of smog that killed 20 people and sickened 7,000 in Donora, Pennsylvania, a mill town on the Monongahela River, 24 miles (39 km) southeast of Pittsburgh.

Lower frequencies go right through, which is why there is a science called &quot;radio astronomy&quot;. Higher frequencies are absorbed in the ionosphere. UV heating takes 1-20 years to descend from the stratosphere in what they call &quot;top-down&quot; solar forcing. The rest, the ionospheric-absorbed energy, is absent from the equation, but it has a nearly instantaneous effect on pressure, aerosols, clouds, and surface temperature in the atmospheric column. Not only does the deposition of this current affect the atmosphere, but the resistive atmosphere creates heat from the current, which is also a big &quot;0&quot; in 100% of climate models.

I don't have the time to deprogram you. You have to do that on your own. By research study careful and spot on to details. Most importantly to be honest with yourself and others. If you can't be honest with yourself or you let others think for you. You'll never find the truth. There are people who try to deceive others. They know the truth and on purpose try to deceive. There are theory's that are turned into fact and later disproved. By few or by many. You Said ...." Described themselves as Scientist" ... " Foolish Things" .... The Scientist.... I was referring to were not foolish , and had good reason to believe what they did. They used the Scientific method which is supposed to be used to day. And when I spoken of the 35 mph it was done under these conditions and approved by the world's leading Scientist at the time. Another one , Just like turning lead into gold and nobody could do it, and for thousands of years until the 20th Century. they thought and taught that lead could never be turned into gold! But we now know that's not true anymore. You mentioned checking, you don't think people tryed to check and see if they could turn lead into gold! Of course! And still do today! And for thousands of years they tried and failed. Millions! We already spoke about this already, and you told me Millions or more Scientist working on climate change! Back to your programed mind. You failed to prove that! Period. Zoo keepers of America don't qualify as Scientist in my book! I guess it does in yours. Since it does means your intellectually dishonest. Because your intellectually dishonest and arrogant it's almost not worth having a conversation with you. Because I can put an orange in your hands and you'll say it's an red apple! And that for me is boring to talk to an animal instead of a real person who can think for themselves. And be honest about things. Next just because you have many Scientist agree on something and it's " many " or even all doesn't make their report of climate change correct! Large body's of Scientists have been wrong before! And peer-reviewed dosen't make it any more credited. Unlike making gold climate change can't be reproduced with out help of computers. Which gives room for errors. Since I have been in the computer field for years I know how that can happen! You can ask Intel about mathematical computer errors from there CPUs and other overflows of current on the motherboards, and data loss from memory from static RAM or hardrive disk defragmentations especially during intensive number crunching. All that and more can mess up your weather experimentation. Big time. And they wouldn't even know it! Oceans have been cooler before and hotter before nothing to do with green house gases. Remember gasses leak into space. So green house can't happen. Scientific method Science is a cycle of theory and experiment. Scientific theories 1 are created to explain the results of experiments that were created under certain conditions. A successful theory will also make newpredictions about new experiments under new conditions. Eventually, though, it always seems to happen that a new experiment comes along, showing that under certain conditions the theory is not a good approximation or is not valid at all. The ball is then back in the theorists’ court. If an experiment disagrees with the current theory, the theory has to be changed, not the experiment. (2) Theories should both predict and explain. The requirement of predictive power means that a theory is only meaningful if it predicts something that can be checked against experimental measurements that the theorist did not already have at hand. That is, a theory should be testable. Explanatory value means that many phenomena should be accounted for with few basic principles. If you answer every “why” question with “because that’s the way it is,” then your theory has no explanatory value. Collecting lots of data without being able to find any basic underlying principles is not science. (3) Experiments should be reproducible. An experiment should be treated with suspicion if it only works for one person, or only in one part of the world. Anyone with the necessary skills and equipment should be able to get the same results from the same experiment. This implies that science transcends national and ethnic boundaries; you can be sure that nobody is doing actual science who claims that their work is “Aryan, not Jewish,” “Marxist, not bourgeois,” or “Christian, not atheistic.” An experiment cannot be reproduced if it is secret, so science is necessarily a public enterprise. As an example of the cycle of theory and experiment, a vital step toward modern chemistry was the experimental observation that the chemical elements could not be transformed into each other, e.g., lead could not be turned into gold. This led to the theory that chemical reactions consisted of rearrangements of the elements in di↵erent combinations, without any change in the identities of the elements themselves. The theory worked for hundreds of years, and was confirmed experimentally over a wide range of pressures and temperatures and with many combinations of elements. Only in the twentieth century did we learn that one element could be transformed into one another under the conditions of extremely high pressure and temperature existing in a nuclear bomb or inside a star. That observation didn’t completely invalidate the original theory of the immutability of the elements, but it showed that it was only an approximation, valid at ordinary temperatures and pressures.

TODAY, we have a structure of Checking. TODAY, we demand Observations/Theories/Experiments, then review/critiques by other scientists, and then we require Mass Publication in front of many many other scientists (( Currently estimated at around a million scientists/researchers etc. worldwide)) ...for further critique and for others to develop alternative theories, observations, Experiments, Replication etc....then the test of time against newer theories by other, probably younger scientists. There was just a prime example of THIS SYSTEM proving itself invaluable. A new report was published about a rapid increase in Ocean Warming....a Scientist/Skeptic looked at the scientific/mathematical underpinnings of this report.....Published a CRITICALLY IMPORTANT REVIEW of this STUDY.....the error was found and admitted ! .

At this point you are in denial, grasping for air. You should either research the truth or apologize and admit YOU WERE WRONG in making those statements. Each step of the way you look more like your trying to deceive not only your self but others. This is the pattern I see in other climate change people. That you have shown here. You can't have a reasonable conversation with individuals who can't agree and see facts from fiction. Who can not see the same orange or apple in there observed hands. I have seen it first hand where people will literally deny what they see! I have meet many people who base there whole judgements on feelings and none on facts or Scientific Evidence. Some of those people also believe climate change is man made. In my opinion the Earth is too large for man himself to change the whole climate period. Next that gasses leak into space not only through our magnet north and south poles but through weak magnetic anomalies, like the one over Africa. You can seek the Truth for your self. Weather is extremely complicated occurrence and man has still not grasp the entirety of the subject. Hopefully my comments have not offended you in any way if they have my apologies this is supposed to be just a discussion how about fake climate change. The truth shall make you free.

There was a recent study that showed that the ice sheets in the north and south poles have not only grown, but have expanded to a size larger than supposed "pre-warming" times. 2) Are you still trying to say modern human society -- and it's activity -- is somehow responsible for climate change? I fail to see how, when in at least two different historical eras before the Industrial Revolution, there were miniature ice ages: One during the Roman times, one during the Middle Ages -- which means that more change occurred then than is occurring today. 3) Lastly, there is a natural fact that you cannot refute. This fact is that when Mount St. Helens last erupted, that volcanic eruption was 27,000 times greater than that of the Hiroshima bomb. As a result, that one eruption put out more sedementary rock, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane than has the entirety of the amount of air pollution humanity has put into the air since 1840 -- which was the start of the Industrial Revolution. Therefore, your argument is an utter failure for lacking in taking Earth science into account. There is estimated, by the USGS, that around 2,000 volcanic eruptions happen every year -- and even if the 0.1° C rise in temp figure is correct -- that means man's activity is infinitesimal compared to all of the natural upheaval happening. And yet you still think that man is the primary source for climate change? Tell me, who is paying for your trolling on this channel? Because evidently, you're not paid to think and use logic. Not only that, but you seemingly are trying to claim "man is responsible," just so you can justify government intervention into people's freedoms and liberties, and therefore affecting people's way of life. This, notwithstanding the fact that CO2 levels have fallen to pre-1974 levels. And what was significant about 1974? It was the year that the EPA required that lead in gasoline, as a lubricant for fuel pumps, be eliminated in gas. Cars today -- because people like you always bring up cars -- are more efficient. Second, the hybrids you always think is going to save the world? Not going to. Not ever. Why? Because the power for their massive battery packs are still generated by fossil fuels. And, those batteries are made by unethical mining and manufacturing processes in places like China. To put it bluntly, you have blinders on to what reality actually is -- and you also, inherently, play the "appeal to emotion" fallacy by attempting to make me, and others who believe as I do, feel guilty because we don't live in an urban areas with public transportation, and that we actually like having a car and using a car. You don't like that, so to try and get us to stop what you see as "evil," you try and make us feel guilty. Sorry to burst your bubble, I don't feel guilty about having a car or using a car. I hate living in a major city (I've lived in 2 of them: Cincinnati, Ohio, and San Diego, California). I like having a car or truck and not being dependent on a bus, taxi, or Uber. I like my freedom -- which is why I am critical of any idea that basically attempts to make me, appealing to emotion, change my life because you don't like the way I live my life. You have lost the argument. There is no way you can overcome the data on volcanic explosions and eruptions, let alone overcome that data to say "man is causing global warming through CO2 greenhouse gas emissions."

Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. . Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly. . If all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth’s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. . Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including: water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, (interfere with escaping Thermal IR Radiation) & act to make the surface much warmer than this, because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere warm. . Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could never have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. . When the energy leaving Earth is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established. Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities ALTER Earth’s energy balance and thus its climate. . Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming/fuel/lumber) (Mining off mountain tops) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere. (Google ACID RAIN & then Google OZONE Depletion) Scientists have determined that when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth’s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increasing in CO2.

The two things are the "apples to oranges" fallacy. And while acid rain was a problem, CO2 is not -- because of the biochemical processes on both ends. Deforestation would be the indication of whether a buildup of CO2 is happening globally. Therefore, pointing to only one or two areas -- while ignoring areas that it no longer is happening, because correction -- is intellectually dishonest, at the minimum. Further, places like China produce more air pollution today than the US ever did -- because higher population for given amount of time. Further, China does not have the Clean Air Act as a law -- which means that even if the US cut all CO2 output to 0, it would, logically be a problem still -- because national sovreignity. This is why I call the "global warming/CO2" problem a scare. Lastly, the hysteria does not take into account the changes that have happened historically, irrespective of man's activities. And nor can we make judgment calls today, using modern technology, to say "something is wrong" when, in order to claim the moral high ground, ALL factors must be taken into account, including geopolitics. If any argument fails to account for everything, then it fails as a moral argument, and therefore fails as a government call to action. Therefore, since most of the "global warming" arguments have been debunked -- including the "97% Consensus" argument, I see no logic or rationale to agree with the "global warming/climate change" hysterical hypocrisy.

When you add in the fact that the entirety of Earth's population could fit into an area the size of Texas, comfortably, then you begin to see that humanity really is not contributing all that much to climate change -- particularly since CO2 levels from cars are now at the same levels we had in the early 1970s.

The main point of contention: "is climate change man-made" , if yes, is there something we can proactively do about it, that has an imact? . ((STOP doing those things that caused CLIMATE CHANGE.)) . .stop deforestation. .PLANT Trees. .Stop burning fossil fuels .encourage all renewable alternative energy sources etc.)) Sceptics / Deniers Contend: From our standpoint it isn't obvious whether either is true, if you take into consideration that before the Maunder minimum temperatures were so warm globally, you could grow wine grade grapes in the central UK. So the earth has been significantly warmer than it is now. . Our Response: It was a nice Tall Tale to believe in 30+ years ago, when I first read it. But TODAY, WE KNOW: 1. ((Wine Grapes have been grown in GreenLand, Nova Scotia and Scotland for centuries AND are still being grown there)) 2. ((This Holocene Warm period reached a temperature peak around 7500-8000 years ago)) 3. ((Temps since then have been falling slowly toward the next Natural Glaciation)) 4. ((The Reason the Medieval Warm period is remembered is because is was a welcome interlude from the steadily falling temperatures, not because it was SOOO warm)) 5. ((In the Mid 1950's, The Earth surpassed the warmest period in thousands of years.)) 6. (( Take a look: http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png . Sceptics / Deniers Contend: There is neither clear Agreement, consensus or evidence about what caused the "Little-Ice age", how it ended and will it happen again. (( There is a clear & widely held understanding that the LITTLE ICE AGE was the continued downward drift of temperatures toward the NEXT GLACIATION combined with volcanic eruptions. . ..which is clearly demonstable thru human records and proxy measurements. and That COMBINED WITH THE MAUNDER SOLAR Minimum,(extending & deepening the cold) which resulted...not in a true ice age, but some darn cold winters even freak snows in N. Africa ...in Washington, DC in Summer etc))) Sceptics / Deniers Suggest: I find it fascinating that while the world gets all worked up about global warming, we might actually need to be more mindful of the possibility of increased global cooling and perhaps weaker solar radiation, which I feel will be infinitly more deadly to humanity. ((( In point of fact, solar energy output has been decreasing a bit for 50 years ! ...and while this has been occurring and subject to nearly 100 Peer-Reviewed studies all over the world, Temperatures have been increasing and that increase has been accellerating. ))) Sceptics / Deniers Contend: Always take a multivaried analysis to topics such as this. . It isn't always obvious the ' group ' has it right, at. al. . For the better part of a century, Global Warming & Resulting climate changes have been a minority viewpoint in science. Heavily Challenged and even ridiculed over the centuries. Since the advances in Satellite Technology and the increasing use of other technology. 1st Global Warming & It's Climate Changes have been challenged, 2nd YET EVERY major study has ONLY STRENGTHENED the dominance of Global Warming Theory (1000's of them). ** "It was December 1984, President Reagan had just been elected to his second term, Dynasty was the top show on TV and Madonna's Like a Virgin topped the musical charts. It was also the last time the Earth had a cooler-than-average month. Last month marked the planet's 400th consecutive month with above-average temperatures, federal scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday.

Unquestionably, it’s climate change, caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels. *** Solar Energy Decreases YET Global Warming Increases, more rapidly. https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/TvsTSI.png	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UgyQ4Cj0f1jotshmwIx4AaABAg	Suspicious0bservers

I am concerned by your comment about "conservation of energy" ...which has nothing to do with energy that enters Earth's System....warms the Earth....and Earth then emitting INFRA RED THERMAL RADIATION (---low energy radiation---which is highly reactive to atmospheric gasses) toward the cold of space, in accordance with the law of thermodynamics .... this is not a sealed system....so conservation of energy does not apply as you state.

Ben claims that TSI is underestimated by 30%. Only 30%. If maximum TSI change reconstructed by last hundreds of years was 3Wm-2 and solar forcing calculated is 0.35 Wm-2 ((3*0.7*0.7)/4, where 0.7 is response of climate system so called thermal inertia of oceans, another 0.7 is albedo, /4 due to the fact that cross section of earth is 4 times lower that its surface), then temperature change is only 0.27 C degress assuming climate sensitivity = 0.75 C/Wm-2 as in last ice age. After adding lacking 30% you have 0.35 C. It still cannot reverse global warming during last 150 years. CO2 radiative forcing is 2 Wm-2, methane 0.6 Wm-2, by adding another greenhouse gases we have 3.2 Wm-2 in compare to pre industrial era.

We also know how a climate system will behave in the case of volcanic eruptions and we know how strong they can be, but we are not so sure when they can occur. We know oceanic forcings of these all oceanic oscilations. They are not more than 0.4 Wm-2. Off course there is some uncertainty in it for example the uncertainty of CO2 radiative forcing is +/- 0.2 Wm-2, aerosols is +/-0.5 Wm-2 (since pre industrial era). Everything in nature sciences has it own uncertainty.	UCPBxexWHxp0P3HMeYMqK80w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPBxexWHxp0P3HMeYMqK80w	1	UgyQ4Cj0f1jotshmwIx4AaABAg	Suspicious0bservers

There was a HEAT WAVE in the United States. 2.5% of the Earth's Surface Area. SO WHAT? THAT is not an attack on Global Warming/Climate change, but rather a verification of the Changes In Climate first Discussed by Alexander von Humboldt in 1799 and Discussed by Thomas Jefferson and John Adams 1799-1804. .

TENS of millions of data sets from every city, town, village around the world. . YOU SAY Much of your argument seems to be anchored in 1970 the year the iris sat was launched. Any comparison of escaping IR using 1970 as a base line would not be very useful as 1970 was at the end of a dramatic cooling trend that started at the close of WWII. . ------> Proving that you do not know nearly as much as you think you know! MUCH OF MY ARGUMENT IS BASED ON 200 YEARS OF SOLID SCIENCE. ... you failed to do your due diligence...you just choose a lazy questioning with no basis in fact. . THERE ARE A SERIES of satellites & experiments which verify/replicate IR DATA over the last 50 years. It is a CLEAR FACT that there is MORE DOWNWARD I.R. THERMAL RADIATION than total I.R. Thermal Radiation entering the Atmosphere from the sun. . THAT IS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE of GLOBAL WARMING. . The increase in Downward Radiation is a combination of All incoming Solar IR radiation with the additional radiation captured by greenhouse gasses and re-radiated back to earth. YOU SAY Besides I have doubts that either one of those satellites are far enough away from the earth to get a true picture of how much IR is escaping on a mean scale as the aperture of the instruments would not be wide enough to measure it from a low earth orbit. . ------> There are many satellites used to study climate (not 1 or 2, as you sneer) and they are hundred of Kilometers in the sky...above the ionosphere. ------> THAT IS HARDLY LOW EARTH ORBIT as you desperately allege in support you limp-wristed arguments. ------> I really don't care if you have doubts...compounded by YOUR NEED to come up with SOME specious argument to defeat redundant & replicated Science. . YOU SAY But you are correct as it has warmed since 1970 but to say "TEMPERATURES ON EARTH HAVE “ DRAMATICALLY INCREASED “ is a huge over exaggeration. . ------> In geologic history we have records stretching millions of years...NATURAL TEMPERATURE CHANGES, on the rapid side, is 1C in 7500 years.

The Earth is undergoing a mass extinction, which is caused by human activity that destroys habitats and kills off species. In a new study, Danish researchers concluded that so many mammal species will go extinct in the next 50 years that the planet's evolutionary diversity won't recover for at least 3 million years. The scientists said their findings could be used to help determine which endangered species are the biggest priorities for conservation efforts. Humans are & will cause so many mammal species to go extinct in the next 50 years that the planet's evolutionary diversity won't recover for 3 to 5 million years, a team of researchers has found. The Earth may be entering its sixth mass extinction: an era in which the planet's environments change so much that most animal and plant species die out. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature predicts that 99.9% of critically endangered species and 67% of endangered species will be lost within the next 100 years. The five other times a mass extinction has occurred over the past 450 million years, natural disasters were to blame. But now, human activity is killing mammal species..." * * * *** "....Brian Lister, a biologist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York A new report suggests that the problem is more widespread than scientists realized. Huge numbers of bugs have been lost in a pristine national forest in Puerto Rico, the study found, and the forest's insect-eating animals have gone missing, too. In 2014, an international team of biologists estimated that, in the past 35 years, the abundance of invertebrates such as beetles and bees decreased by 45 percent. In places where long-term insect data are available, mainly in Europe, insect numbers are plummeting. A study last year showed a 76 percent decrease in flying insects in the past few decades in German nature preserves. The latest report, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that the problem extends to the Americas. The study's authors implicate climate change in the loss of tropical invertebrates." * * * * ***** "...“These are NASA scientists. They are not Democrats or Republicans.

Species loss is hard to guage since they are hard to measure and we dont know exactly how fast it has happened historically. Not all species are in the fossil record. Second, it is important to make informed decisions. That is what 'real men' do. Part of that is having the courage to be wrong. The Law of Conservation of Energy isnt a suggestion. All energy that is inputted into the Earths system has to be accounted for. It just doesnt go away and we are much better at measuring how much the planet radiates than absorbs and even that has huge holes in it.

There are some videos here in Youtube that explain how this &quot;97%&quot; number was created.

We have NEVER seen the actual data. there are e-mail scandals that they had to alter the data to remove decades that did not fit the agenda. the &#39;data sets&#39; are not available for mathematical evaluations. <br />the scientific documentation of the cooling in the first decade showed that 1998 was hotter based on the same instruments, the same data collection, the same procedures. then, because it did not fit the agenda, it was erased. Erased, not by science, but by political pressure and replaced with a totally fabricated and not measured thing. <br />prove me wrong, post a link to the data sets.

I have watched as some look at the Earths orbit and how we cycle every so many millennia from the Northern Hemisphere being closer in winter. as we are now. if the massive winter snow falls on the oceans, like it would in this era, phase change would prevent accumulation. however, as snow falls on land when the northern hemisphere is further in winter, the snow can accumulate. In my pedestrian view, this would cause a runaway cycle. The white would reflect the heat. Alas, at this point in science, I believe that we do not have enough information to draw firm conclusions.

You can look at multiple reasons why CO2 is a marginal greenhouse gas and how little humans contribute to CO2 overall and come to the easy conclusion that we don&#39;t affect the climate much at all ... but THIS video looks at what the so-called climate scientists IGNORE and leave out of their models - the &quot;particle forcing&quot;, which if it were included (and the data is now available) would show that humans have no major impact on the climate at all ... AND by leaving out this data these scientists are causing their results to DELIBERATELY blame humans ... Are these scientists ignorant? Or are they complicit in a non-conspiracy to keep their government funding flowing and their careers (which have been completely staked on the idea of CO2 induced global warming) afloat.

The lackeys of the bankers are the politicians they control who fund researchers to model and promote anything that is pro-CO2 to the tune of BILLIONS as opposed to the few millions put forward by the anti-AGW companies/corps/people. Current Climate 'Science' is really just the collection of data combined with "climate modelling". Genuine Science however is about 1) proposing a hypothesis; 2) proposing an experiment that would DISPROVE the hypothesis; and 3) conducting that experiment in multiple labs to verify the result. Where do you see this happening in any pro-global warming paper? I'll await your list of papers, but won't hold my breath. Meanwhile, you may chew on these two large contradictions: 1. over the last 15 years CO2 levels have risen dramatically higher, but the Earth hasn't warmed anywhere near the level the models predict -- meaning that the models are leaving out some big important factors ... meaning they are INVALID models ... and yet alarmists keep going on about them as if they were the word of God. 2. CO2 only absorbs infrared at a particular wavelength and the energy of that wavelength of light is already being fully absorbed by the CO2 in the atmosphere ... meaning that to trap more heat, the amount of CO2 must rise exponentially, not linearly ... meaning that the models and really the whole concept of CO2 being a major factor in global warming are nonsensical.

So by telling that &quot;they all started from the same data&quot; means that you haven&#39;t even checked what they looked at or where this &quot;consensus&quot; came. But still sure man made climate change is totally bogus. It all leads to Rockefeller&#39;s NWO plan. They want to control energy and who uses it. Move all production to India and then blame them for CO2 and climate change. UN and WHO in particular are already sterilizing people in Africa and India. Bill Gates already said it. They want to cut down 85% of this planet&#39;s population with vaccines and centralized health care. Not because there are too many, but because they can&#39;t control that many &quot;useless eaters&quot;. They want 200 million white people living in nature friendly cities where everything is provided for everybody. Have you noticed how CO2 does not matter if it comes from burning &quot;biomass&quot; or from natural gas, that produces water vapor, CO2 and was pumped using fracking that destroys ground water and release methane and CO2?

There are numerous studies which have examined this, and yes, the effects we are seeing may be exacerbated by solar activity. Some studies believe we might get some relief in solar input over the next few decades, and here is the controversy, will this prevent permafrost from melting? If the methane stored here is released, there isn’t much debate about the outcome.	UCo_p0bbjcFMbdi886Lycr7A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_p0bbjcFMbdi886Lycr7A	0

Including the "underwater volcanoes" Look, there is a distinct ISOTOPE which denotes Fossil Fuels BURNED for mankind's benefit. WE CAN and DO EASILY MEASURE this ISOTOPE in the CO2 of our Atmosphere.....so throwup all those 'maybe-this- or 'maybe-that' .....WE MEASURE IT and WE KNOW how it is created. Over 40% of the CO2 in our atmosphere is HUMAN CREATED because it show this isotope. We have multiple Satellite which OBSERVE & MEASURE in detail....Earth emissions of INFRA RED THERMAL RADIATION....reaching CO2 molecules and in those exact frequencies....the Thermal Radiation ends...then is RE RADIATED in all directions...much of it back to Earth. If that HEAT is not allowed to escape to the COLD OF SPACE....it stays here and warms the earth. The increase in downward thermal radiation is measured/observed! There is more downward thermal radiation than actually enters the outer atmosphere.... THAT increase is from RE RADIATED IR THERMAL RADIATION OFF GREENHOUSE GASSES !

All along the mid sized roads the plants are black from soot and the bigger roads are worse with no plant life. Rivers are so full of plastic in parts that the water flowing underneath cannot be seen. People defecate and urinate in the streets. Mangy, emancipated, infested, furless dogs and cats roam in certain parts. When there is flooding there are cockroaches everywhere climbing walls. Rats are also common. Beaches except at resorts are full of plastic and sometimes glass. The air is so thick that it is sometimes hard to see a few blocks away and sometimes you pray for rain to clean the air. I have a friend who worked there for about 20 years who just died recently, from lung disease. Places away from the cities were beautiful though. Not climate change but environmental degradation caused in this case by overpopulation.

During Solar Maximum, TCI is high (meaning “Hot”); during Solar Minimum, it is low (meaning “Cold”). <br />“Right now, it is very low indeed … 10 times smaller than we see during more active phases of the solar cycle,” says Mlynczak	UCOOsT3lY8cEYi7h0AZT87Rg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOOsT3lY8cEYi7h0AZT87Rg	0

It has been known for over 140 years that CO2 is a greenhouse gas … Along with water vapour and Methane CH4 …. By simple measurements we know that CO2 has increased by 40% CH4 by 150% and water vapour by 7% .. All the earths main greenhouse gasses … Without which the earth would be at -18&#39;c or a frozen Ice Ball floating in space … To much greenhouse gasses and the earth goes to a hothouse state ….. Transition to either of these states means Mass Extinction of most animal and plant life on Earth … The Earth will go to a hothouse state within the lifetime of a child born today if we stay on our current emissions pathway 40,000,000,000 tons per year … However all the forecasts are that our emissions will double by 2050 …. That my man is quite simply Suicide ….

And what do reptiles thrive in ? .. Yes you guessed it, a hot humid world …. Created by large amounts of CO2 and Water Vapour ... That's why Alligator skeletons are readily found in the Arctic permafrost … The Earth was mainly in a Hothouse state during the whole Triassic/Jurassic epochs … And the geological records show that it takes 10 - 30 million years for the abundant wildlife to recover after a large Climatic Event … There have been 11 Mass Extinctions in the last 900 million years .. so an average of 1 every 70 - 80 million years … 1 caused by Ice Ball Earth. 2 caused by Large Meteor Impact 8 caused by massive CO2 release sending the Earth straight to a Hothouse State … When this happens new spieces that thrive in such an environment emerge … Take your own words .. Thrived for hundreds of thousands of years …. Modern Humans have been about for circa 300,000 years … Humans cannot survive in wet bulb temperature of 53'c and 100% humidity … That kills humans within hours … So unless you are a reptilian ..

SO is not saying global warming is not happening, what he's saying is that the math to draw the conclusion that this warming is all man based( or at least 90% of the problem ) is based of a bad noninclusive mathematical model. When the same mathematical equation is used, with ALL natural factors included, the results show that CO2 emission is close to a non contributing factor to overall warming. That being said how stupid are you? really?

Everyone is wrong but you are right? <br /><br />“Everything “ affects the climate - absolutely everything - Solar cycles, pollution, and .....emotions. It’s like saying the pacific garbage patch isn’t hurting anything in the ocean cause ....it’s a big ocean. What a dumb thing that would be to say, right? To say the human footprint is zero / meaningless is an argument that is irresponsible at best. <br /><br />We know volcanic gasses kill trees and wildlife even if not going off. We know freon hurts the ozone. Weather is a part of nature and therefore is affected by “everything” (natural and man made). Now we have to wait to see how bad it gets to just stop polluting as much? Why not step back and just think in common sense terms....pick the head up from the paper and look around d at the world in which we live. Why is there even an argument? So we can keep on consuming and overpopulating and taking without sacrificing and giving back a little? Wait - I forgot - the altruistic spirit for nature is second to our own conveniences.

If peer reviewed its unlikely but humans make errors so its possible. Stacking people in high rises...and water doesn’t matter? Water matters! Clean water to boot. You cannot just take surface area and say that is enough lol. That is not even being complete about the population picture. This is way more involved than just looking at surface area and running with that. Ive tried to explain that. In the end - people use resources like crazy.....we are not living like our ancestors did. We consume and have massive amounts of waste. When we use our ocean like a toilet, allow rivers to get hit with toxic runoffs, or overwhelm our air with toxins (check our india online for air quality any day of the year), that makes me “clearly see” we are not capable of slowing down. When people wear masks everywhere they go in China or...(name your polluted area), due to crappy air that is a red flag to me. That tells me people are going to protect their desires and wants above all else - (even the quality of the air they breathe isn’t a deterrent)...and we wont survive if we get to the numbers that the land mass you speak of can sustain (usable land mass). The point is - we pollute the hell out of our planet. I have plenty of garbage so Im a part of that problem (not a green person although it would be good for me to get there). If we can begin having things balance out a little we could sustain more people. But “can” we do that? I don’t see evidence of that. So I am of the mindset that “no - we have no more room for a species that takes and is so hellbent on taking that they cannot even have a lightbulb go off when they cannot see through the air hey breathe, drink the water that flows in front of them....etc. Maybe someone will read this 50/100 years down the road and say one or neither of us was right...I could be wrong about all that Ive studied, and all that conventional wisdom screams out to me. I don’t think I am. You don’t think you are. And thats ok. Thats why we have discussions. I believe there is a balance and a tipping point...that the eco-system relies on some give ...as well as take. More people ....with the resources we have...and the pollution we create...no way will it sustain human life indefinitely at this rate. Im sticking to that. So I respectfully disagree and hope we can agree to disagree on this point.	UCj5esw1Yhyzm1m1QIWo2usg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5esw1Yhyzm1m1QIWo2usg	1	UgzXoshv6Ozw-_0J_w54AaABAg	D Clifford

Don’t want to eat into the 2000 that will be needed to produce food. I’m sure some would have factories on their land to make our tv’s, computers, plastics - keep things going as they are - so everything being made today. Meaning not everyone would use their land for producing food to trade , so to round it up a bit would help so we can take into consideration the millions who will use theirs to make things we all use. Need water for those things but also land fill space.The government land for power weapons etc is probably figured into the 2000 per person I assume. We can’t forget about space for animal habitats since there is delicate ecosystem out there. I am not sure I can add all of the variables into google earth but will for sure try. It’s always good to revisit things. In the 20th century the world population more than doubled. It’s anticipated the growth rate will slow again but due to the amount of people it still puts us at a projected 11.2 billion people by 2100 (Max Roser and Esteban Ortiz-Ospina , 2019. . “World Population Growth".

I say that because we need room to grow/raise livestock to trade (in this scenario) because if I say - live in Montana I can’t grow anything for about 8 months of the year but can raise cattle. I would want to trade some beef for maybe oranges someone else is growing in Florida on their 2000 acres. To do those things we need those ares to be viable.

Doesn’t seem likely but one can measure shoulder to shoulder and try... But we are talking 2000 inhabitable acres for each person (inhabitable means - fresh water, good soil, —-enough to grow different crops for trading so everyone gets their favorite foods and full nutritional needs - cant grow everything everywhere...). There is already a good deal of competition for good inhabitable real estate that isn’t barren...add more people that isn’t going to get better.

What I got from a few simple calculations An acre is 43,560 square feet x 2000 acres = 87,120,000 square feet per person by roughly 8 billion = some crazy big number (6.9696e+16/17). Ill have to check it out this weekend. On my cell now. Will take into account all of wildlife and their square footage plus drinkable water sources... (inhabitable land), etc. Have to have fresh water. If google maps can point out where all of that is at and take that into account that will be helpful. I recall learning in college and then graduate school all about our impact on the planet. But even without any of that knowledge - its easy to look around and see how people are more likely to be takers than givers (it’s in our nature I suppose). Too much of that isn’t a good thing. By the way: Completely believe in sun cycle effects...about twenty years ago I made a chart of how solar minimums (maunder m) - are associated with VEI 6 and greater eruptions. There was a clear connection. It is impressive to watch those speak about the sun who are experts. We just cant say our impact is meaningless. We are still learning so one theory doesn’t have to be wrong to make another right imo...just feel there needs to be some humility and responsibility in research. Sadly people here human impact on climate is zero and this means - “no need to curb my appetite for more consumption.” Thats anecdotal so only what Ive witnessed.

The acts of legislation cleared the smog blankets. Slashing greenhouse effects for 70 years now. The toxic emmisions have been cleared for 70 years. Particularly black smoke from fires and exhausts which has been illegal for many years.<br />Summary. <br />70 years of emmision reduction means they can have NO possible effect on the climate.

I like your incisive dissection and all you need to make it fully real is to add the<br />following (in your rendition).<br />Coriolis force is driving the motion of high density cold polar air away from polar<br />regions toward equatorial belts where Coriolis force dwindles toward zero. In reaction, the displaced polar cold air must be replaced by a reverse low, forming an undulating jet stream flow lines from poles toward equator resembling an open tulip flower nested in another one face to face. As the earth rotates, the air above it lags slightly behind, taking the weather with it. Note Coriolis force is acting in opposite direction on the Southern<br />hemisphere. I am looking forward to your reaction. Andrew P.	UCC2fFvvOk0J10wyZhCGH8Qg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC2fFvvOk0J10wyZhCGH8Qg	0

One, wild fires increased proclivity is largely do to environmentalist not allow natural fires to reset and keep then forest healthy. Also not allow safe responsible logging that would also help. Also natural disaster expense as a % of gdp has been on the decline for the at least the last 60-70 years largely due to technological advancement attributed mostly to the use of fossil fuels.

Anyone who owns a greenhouse knows the amount and size of the flowers as well size of produced is greatly increased when increasing CO2 levels. CO2 also makes plant much more water efficient making them less susceptible to low water conditions. Also if you look into the numbers in the studies you are referring to the highest loss of any given nutrient is less than 10% with most of the nutrients tested being less than a 5% loss. When trying to feed a ever growing population would rather have a slightly less nutrient dense tomato or no tomato at all?

It is so extreme the Micheal Mann himself called it an embarrassment. We note that methane quickly oxidizes to CO2 (half life 13 years). Given that the planet was warmer than now for 300 years in the medieval warm period, may I ask why the huge predicted release of trapped arctic methane did not occur in the medieval warm period? Personally I think that in 12 years the planet will be about the same temperature or slightly cooler than it is now.

There is not one scientist on earth who suggest that major solar outburst and geomagnetic storms represent a drop in solar energy. Most agree it is a 100x - 100,000x increase across wave and particles. Yet, the actual climate models show it as global cooling from the sun. This cooling is not actually occurring, and must be accounted for on the human side, along with any actual effects of the increase in solar energy. With a 10-30 year lag, the solar blasted the crap out of earth from 1950 - 2005. You do the math. Or don't. I don't care, just try to stay focused or you'll be shred from ear to ear like that smile.

UgxmDAnSzMcSMIBVCWZ4AaABAg	6	0	2019-03-03 05:15:53	The Designer	Lets first look at this from incoming light. The Sun, with an effective temperature of approximately 5800 K, is an approximate black body with an emission spectrum peaked in the central, yellow-green part of the visible spectrum. Of that, about 55% of incoming sunlight to Earth is infrared photons. They strike the Earth and are reradiated back out into the atmosphere. The other 45% is white light and of that, about 30% of that is reflected which is what you would see if you were to look at the Earth from outer space. That should leave about 31.5% of the total light being white, to strike the Earth and be reradiated in the Earth&#39;s black body 255k infrared range back into the atmosphere. That would mean 55% infrared photons coming in and 86.5% total infrared photons going out. As we increase secondary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we block more incoming infrared photons, slightly cooling off the planet. Being there are more outgoing infrared photons than incoming, we should trap more outgoing infrared photons than reflecting incoming photons. That being said, all things being equal, the planet must heat.	UCbT9je9R-uyFkHqskQOWkSg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbT9je9R-uyFkHqskQOWkSg	0

If we build breeder reactors first and use that electricity to produce solar panels, the BTU multiplier effect would be 2000*9=18,000 to 1. Considering a coal-fired power plant has a ratio of about 80 to 1, that figures out to be about 18,000/80=225 times the increase in efficiency. Doing so would flatten out the hierarchies of the world, creating vastly greater independence worldwide. This would accomplish exactly what the murderous communists attempted but badly failed at.

If anyone has a different solution, I'd like to hear it. Let's begin with BTUs out vs BTU in by the energy source. Corn 1.3 Solar PV 9 Natural gas 10 Windmills 18 Light Water Reactors 80 Coal 80 Hydropower 100 LFTR and TWR 2,000 Now, consider deaths per terrawatt. Coal 161 Oil 36 Biomass 12 Peat 12 Natural gas 4 Solar PV .44 Hydropower .10 Light water reactors .04 LFTR and TWR .003 This does not include the one to two million people that die from cooking with carbon-based fuels. Solar ovens are by far the better way to go. As you can see LFTRs and TWRs are the most cost efficient and safest energy supply possible at this time. We should easily be able to reach $0.02 to $0.03 per kilowatt-hour. That brings the price of everything down substantially. Building small mass-produced modular breeder reactors would also make windmills and solar panels exceptionally cost-effective. We could have the population producing the majority of their own energy leaving nuclear energy for industry. Or we can continue with this absurd global warming debate.

UgxmDAnSzMcSMIBVCWZ4AaABAg.8s-gTA2mKDU8s-ge2bRA5h		0	2019-03-03 05:17:30	The Designer	As the temperature rises, the Hadley cell will increase in size, blocking moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranian ocean, consequently pushing the Mexican and the Sahara Deserts north. This will turn Europe and the North American Continent into desert regions. The Sahara desert itself becomes a wetland again. Unfortunately, the temperature will be too high for us large-brained humans to survive and thrive in these conditions. Due to the increase in Arctic temperature, the Thermohaline circulation will slow down allowing the Equatorial region to heat even further, increasing cyclones the size of the last interglacial period when massive chunks of the reef were thrown on top of cliffs.

UgxmDAnSzMcSMIBVCWZ4AaABAg.8s-gTA2mKDU8s-gaxJBvuD		0	2019-03-03 05:17:05	The Designer	As the atmosphere warms, the differential temperature decreases between the ocean's surface and the atmosphere, blocking the ocean from releasing its heat. In addition, about half of the 37 gigatonnes is going into the oceans, also blocking the infrared heat from escaping the oceans and preventing the atmosphere from warming as much as expected. This is where 93% of the additional heat is being stored. This additional heat in the oceans will not only melt the ice caps but will allow vastly larger hurricanes to form and travel at much greater distances. The imminent threat isn't sea level rise but a future of massive storm surges. This website gives a more detailed explanation. https://www.skepticalscience.com/How-Increasing-Carbon-Dioxide-Heats-The-Ocean.html	UCbT9je9R-uyFkHqskQOWkSg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbT9je9R-uyFkHqskQOWkSg	1	UgxmDAnSzMcSMIBVCWZ4AaABAg	The Designer
UgxmDAnSzMcSMIBVCWZ4AaABAg.8s-gTA2mKDU8s-gYGklwXO		0	2019-03-03 05:16:35	The Designer	Now let us look at this from the secondary greenhouse gases position. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. That is it both absorbs and releases infrared photons. Once released, there is one chance in 41,253 that infrared photon will continue within one degree in the same direction. This basically gives that photon a 50/50 chance of going either up or down. Since the oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface, this gives that photon about a 35% chance of hitting a body of water. Infrared photons will not penetrate a body of water's surface, but will instead excite an H2O molecule causing evaporation. H2O is the primary greenhouse gas which prevents the Earth from having a climate like our moon. Consequently, the more CO2 we put into the atmosphere, the more H2O gets into the atmosphere, the warmer the planet gets. This is how a 46% increase in CO2 caused a 7% increase in absolute humidity. The present increase in temperature due to this combination of additional H2O and CO2 with over a doubling of CH4, in the atmosphere is approximately .9C. Because it takes a tremendous amount of time for the oceans to heat, it will take centuries for the Earth to reach temperature equilibrium. If we continue to inject 37 gigatonnes annually of CO2 into the atmosphere, that heating process will continue to accelerate.

In other words, more data points with false premises DON'T MATTER. This inductive issue has been written about extensively for at least a thousand years. It was commonly believed that swans were only white, until a rare species of black swan was found in Australia. Meaning, the sample set of swans was missing data and ultimately without the complete data any conclusions were useless. This is the same case, ignoring forces into the system makes said data incomplete. Any conclusions drawn from incomplete data is invalid. This video calls out that x + y = c, and the absence of x would mean a fraudulent inflation of c given a constant y. YOU can debunk his claim by proving that x doesn't matter, or making an argument why it doesn't matter. Otherwise please exit the discussion.

It has been cycling for billions of years, and ice cores and tree rings show that climate is much more influenced by the orbital changes than by solar fluctuations. X Ray emissions have zero heating effect on the climate, their mention is another &quot;whatabout&quot; red herring. Cloud seeding from cosmic rays are not well understood, but by no measure do they account for the modern warming trend. <br /><br />This whole &quot;technical&quot; analysis is an amateur attempt to cast doubt on a century of improving scientific understanding. Of course scientists calculate the natural factors influencing climate. They say that greenhouse forcing only took the lead as the strongest (more than half) influence ahead of volcanism, solar variation and still by a large margin, cloud cover.<br /><br />The solar forcing equation is 3C of warming for every doubling of CO2. We&#39;re right on track at just over 1C warming after a record breaking 40% increase in carbon in just 140 years. There is NO REASON TO DOUBT THE CONCLUSIONS OF MAINSTREAM SCIENCE. It&#39;s all up for revision, but the dangers of denialism include things like anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers and creationists.

No one we know of in the debate denies climate change. It's often linked to derogatory names for people with fringe beliefs. The hard-core published scientists who have been called before Congress to testify about a contrarian view on climate change, for example, primarily focus on the weakness of correlation between CO2 in the atmosphere and global temperature. The grafts presented to support these predictions are apples and oranges. The temperature of air over land forms the baseline, while satellite data including over-water air temperature is averaged into the later data. As we all know, including the overall warmer over-water air temperature drives the average global temperature up by 1C vs the over-land air temperature. However, since the "deniers" are so ignorant (in your opinion) you shouldn't have to be concerned about the truth outing you. Also, the grafts should obfuscate the other predictions: The polar bears are not extinct, our grandchildren know what snow is, the ice sheets haven't melted, New York isn't under water, and the brutally cold winter this year doesn't fit the IPCC climate model from 2000. But what if you have people with the power and money to spray our atmosphere with metal, designed to reflect sun rays, while there is a natural cooling cycle underway over the next two or three decades (as some brilliant scientists predict who also deftly predicted this winter's historically colder weather) and this turns devastatingly shorter growing seasons into catastrophic global food shortages? Well many global warming worshipers think that the real problem is "too many people". So for them, either way, it's a good thing.

You believe the papers are rejected because the contradict the status quo? Truth points to itself, why are you afraid of presenting your data to the bigger community?

Seem like you met already 3 of my conditions to GTFO. Now let's finish this - tell me why do you not trust the scientific method? Because peer review - presenting your data and receiving feedback from your peers (people who will point out IF you're full of shit) - is one of the corner stones of modern scientific method. Just publish your data. This smells too much of confirmation bias and fear of exposure - typical signs of pseudoscience.

So it would seem that the currents in at the poles get distributed quickly along the surface and there has to be a resistor effect of that current flowing back through the atmosphere to complete some sort of an electrical circuit.<br /> When we look at the mountains on the Moon, Mercury, and Mars, there are virtually no Lichtenberg pattern to them, like there is on the Earth&#39;s mountains. So the water vapor and other charge carrying chemicals in our atmosphere must have had a huge role in mountain building in the past, as it does today in distributing the currents along the surface then back through the atmosphere.

Just the fact that this ‘97%’ has been thrown into the public sphere, has to make you suspicious.	UCDcI-TLWzOI_Tiwm3tW2FyQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDcI-TLWzOI_Tiwm3tW2FyQ	0

There has been as far as I know about half a dozen studies on "climate consensus". The one I reference and that I think is the most telling has nothing to do with surveys and no scientists were contacted. The group that did the study simply looked at the information from a large group of studies from many different disciplines, like geology, glaciology, atmospheric studies and various others. If the study had no information about climate it was set aside if it showed information on the climate, it was used. 97% of the studies they found to have information involving the climate showed either or both of two things. 1 the world is getting warmer, and/or 2 we are responsible for the speed at witch the climate is changing.

"Depending on the method, the many studies on this subject show that from 97.1% to 99.99% of climate scientists -- defined as researchers publishing in peer-reviewed journals -- accept that the climate is rapidly changing due to human actions. . The degree of severity they ascribe to impacts of climate change varies according to their specific areas of study and their models, but those ranges are captured in the IPCC 5 scenarios, all of which show not only warming but significant negative impacts. . The high end and very recent study shows 99.99% widespread agreement/consensus. . James L. Powell, director of the National Physical Sciences Consortium, did the most recent of Many peer-reviewed, published studies showing the overwhelming consensus by climate scientists on anthropogenic climate change. . Here's what he says: If the consensus were 97%, then to find 3 peer-reviewed articles that reject AGW, one would need to read, on average, 100 articles. Instead, to find even a single rejecting article, one must read nearly 5,000 articles. The true consensus on AGW cannot be as low as 97%. [...] The only sound and practical way to judge the extent of a scientific consensus is to search for articles that reject the prevailing theory. For 2013 and 2014, I found that only 5 of 24,210 articles and JUST 4 of 69,406 researcher/authors rejected anthropogenic global warming. . His full paper is linked from that site. Also very recently, Benestad et al published a paper in the journal Theoretical Applied Climatology in July 2015. They spread an even wider net than Powell, looking at every significant paper ever published in a peer-reviewed journal that denied anthropogenic climate change. . * They found 38 papers. * . A common denominator seems to be missing contextual information or ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions, be it other relevant work or related geophysical data. In many cases, short-comings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup. Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, or basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics. [...] We also note that several of these papers involved the same authors and that the different cases were not independent even if they involved different shortcomings. Some of the cases also implied interpretations that were incompatible with some of the other cases, such as pronounced externally induced geophysical cycles and a dominant role of long-term persistence (LTP); slow stochastic fluctuations associated with LTP make the detection of meaningful cycles from solar forcing difficult if they shape the dominant character in the geophysical record. . Page on springer.com It other words, the papers don't agree with one another, they are written in fairly obvious ignorance of reasonably well known science and modelling basics and there are a handful of authors who keep writing stuff that's in denial, not a large number of them. The authors of this paper -- disclosure: I've communicated with Lewandowsky, one of the authors, many times -- bend over backward to avoid saying the obvious about the authors, instead treating them with respect and suggesting reasons why they might, possibly, maybe have just been accidentally ignorant. . But what about that 97%? . Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. . In addition, nearly ALL of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. . Scientific Overwhelming Agreement / consensus: Earth's climate is warming . Here are the five major papers that arrived at 97%: J. Cook, et al, "Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature," Environmental Research Letters Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 Quotation from page 3: "Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW [Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming], 97.1% endorsed the scientific consensus. Among scientists who expressed a position on AGW in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.” W. R. L. Anderegg, “Expert Credibility in Climate Change,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Vol. 107 No. 27, 12107-12109 (21 June 2010); DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1003187107. P. T. Doran & M. K. Zimmerman, "Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change," Eos Transactions American Geophysical Union Vol. 90 Issue 3 (2009), 22; DOI: 10.1029/2009EO030002. N. Oreskes, “Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,” Science Vol. 306 no. 5702, p. 1686 (3 December 2004); DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618. . So we have seven peer-reviewed and published papers which use different techniques, published from 2004 to 2015, which show that the consensus among climate science papers is in excess of 97% and that there are a tiny number of dissenters who are making obviously incorrect statements. 1. You can argue with one paper which has not been reproduced. 2. It's harder to argue with a paper whose results have been reproduced. 3. And it's much harder to argue with multiple different methodologies which arrive at the same result. 4. In the case of climate scientists having a very STRONG COMMON AGREMENT or a consensus on the basics of anthropogenic climate change, consilience is extremely high.

Obama sunk billions into solar companies that all went bust. Here in CA our power bills have skyrocketed. Our water bills, as well and now, it's been raining off and on for 2 months... the snow all over the country is insanely abundant- the snow pack has been huge for the last 3 winters. Here in CA, we don't need to cut back on water, to a ridiculous degree, (none of the politicians or Hollywood nutjobs do), we need reservoirs. We need desalination plants. The earth is 72% water. We don't HAVE a water shortage. We have a lack of planning to deal with water and CA is a desert... OY VEY. I don't believe that we have reached any kind of tipping point. It's really cold here in CA- unusually cold and it appears to directly coincide with lack of sunspot activity. Taxing the evil oil companies did nothing but make EVERYTHING more expensive- everything. And we have made strides in reducing pollution from cars. I can remember in the 60's and 70's when it was smokey just looking across the street. It's not like that now. Our improvements may be slow but they exist and when somebody builds a better mousetrap, people will buy it. If we can allow the companies doing the technological work to find a way to make solar energy more efficient, less expensive, provide a way to store it, a way to keep birds from vaporizing over solar farms and being chopped to death on wind turbines- look, I know that like everything, there are gong to be compromises but again, 73 TRILLION dollars for the green new deal because AOC says the world will end in 12 years? PLEASE! And if it's cold because it's hot, please somebody, tell me how the ice ages in the past happened and how they melted? Tell me why the continuous emission of sulfur dioxide from Yellowstone and 20 or 30 more active volcanoes are not creating problems for our atmosphere and adding C02? Maybe they're not adding C02 but dang, they are polluting the s**t out of our air. Nature is just so awesome- the moon used to be a zillion times closer to earth than it is now and we used to have 1000ft waves.. I know I'm off topic and I guess, doing another "manifesto" but these, to me, are examples of how HUGE this stuff is. Remember when scientists said we had to stop eating eggs? They have been proved to be nearly the perfect food. How about how bad coffee was for you.. until they realized that it has more anti-oxidants than just about any other beverage.. there are zillions of examples like this. We are all learning. Science is learning.. we haven't even talked about pathogens. Viruses are almost all from birds- the ones that fly really high. Where are they getting these viruses? MILLIONS died from the Spanish Flu- far more than the plague. How come bacteria is so smart that it morphs to render so many medications ineffective? I don't know, this is just BIG BIG stuff and I think we take drastic action to our great peril.. and maybe I'm just another nutjob. 8-)	UCG9RqMmHEd5GyJqABZV5g-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG9RqMmHEd5GyJqABZV5g-A	1	UgzbsgnYpy119zruUfJ4AaABAg	Inisfad

But so far our best realistic case is either just bad or very bad, the only thing for sure is that the more we delay the worst it will get. I'm puzzled as to why you think "models" are a bad thing to predict how bad it might get, maybe you suggest we just try to wait and see how bad it actually gets then invent a time machine? maybe repeat that a few times so it is "scientific" ? ... interesting ..

I don't want to tar and feather ANYONE but science has become corrupted and political. Name a single prediction that has come true, please. And don't use the Arctic because it has grown and shrunk many, many times over the millennia. I'm not a scientist to be sure but I am truly, very suspicious of the intent and extent of knowledge of our politicians and they are the ones who are driving the catastrophe belief as well as money in the science community. I might be proven dead wrong but I do not believe we are headed for any kind of catastrophe, any time soon. And even if we did EVERYTHING we are supposed to do to clean up C02, etc., the effect, in 100 years is computer modeled to be truly minuscule. And, we're depending on computer models for our predictions... I'm rather surprised at the hatred I'm getting for being skeptical but, that's the world we live in today. I don't actually care because I'm not offended easily but it seems that "tolerance" of differing points of view only extends to certain people about certain things. Some scientists, (and Al Gore), are saying "the science is settled". Other scientists are saying it's not. The pressure, ostracizing, de-funding and refusal of most of the media to even consider differing points of view on what seems to me to be a GIGANTIC group of systems that make up climate, that I don't really think we completely understand yet, is doing what so much of society is doing. Crushing free exchange of ideas and politicians love to keep people scared and take their money, to keep them safe. JUST my opinion and maybe ignorant but we shall see.

"Depending on the method, the many studies on this subject show that from 97.1% to 99.99% of climate scientists -- defined as researchers publishing in peer-reviewed journals -- accept that the climate is rapidly changing due to human actions. . The degree of severity they ascribe to impacts of climate change varies according to their specific areas of study and their models, but those ranges are captured in the IPCC 5 scenarios, all of which show not only warming but significant negative impacts. . The high end and very recent study shows 99.99% widespread agreement/consensus. . James L. Powell, director of the National Physical Sciences Consortium, did the most recent of Many peer-reviewed, published studies showing the overwhelming consensus by climate scientists on anthropogenic climate change. . Here's what he says: If the consensus were 97%, then to find 3 peer-reviewed articles that reject AGW, one would need to read, on average, 100 articles. Instead, to find even a single rejecting article, one must read nearly 5,000 articles. The true consensus on AGW cannot be as low as 97%. [...] The only sound and practical way to judge the extent of a scientific consensus is to search for articles that reject the prevailing theory. For 2013 and 2014, I found that only 5 of 24,210 articles and JUST 4 of 69,406 researcher/authors rejected anthropogenic global warming. . His full paper is linked from that site. Also very recently, Benestad et al published a paper in the journal Theoretical Applied Climatology in July 2015. They spread an even wider net than Powell, looking at every significant paper ever published in a peer-reviewed journal that denied anthropogenic climate change. . * They found 38 papers. * . A common denominator seems to be missing contextual information or ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions, be it other relevant work or related geophysical data. In many cases, short-comings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup. Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, or basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics. [...] We also note that several of these papers involved the same authors and that the different cases were not independent even if they involved different shortcomings. Some of the cases also implied interpretations that were incompatible with some of the other cases, such as pronounced externally induced geophysical cycles and a dominant role of long-term persistence (LTP); slow stochastic fluctuations associated with LTP make the detection of meaningful cycles from solar forcing difficult if they shape the dominant character in the geophysical record. . Page on springer.com It other words, the papers don't agree with one another, they are written in fairly obvious ignorance of reasonably well known science and modelling basics and there are a handful of authors who keep writing stuff that's in denial, not a large number of them. The authors of this paper -- disclosure: I've communicated with Lewandowsky, one of the authors, many times -- bend over backward to avoid saying the obvious about the authors, instead treating them with respect and suggesting reasons why they might, possibly, maybe have just been accidentally ignorant. . But what about that 97%? . Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. . In addition, nearly ALL of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. . Scientific Overwhelming Agreement / consensus: Earth's climate is warming . Here are the five major papers that arrived at 97%: J. Cook, et al, "Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature," Environmental Research Letters Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 Quotation from page 3: "Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW [Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming], 97.1% endorsed the scientific consensus. Among scientists who expressed a position on AGW in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.” W. R. L. Anderegg, “Expert Credibility in Climate Change,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Vol. 107 No. 27, 12107-12109 (21 June 2010); DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1003187107. P. T. Doran & M. K. Zimmerman, "Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change," Eos Transactions American Geophysical Union Vol. 90 Issue 3 (2009), 22; DOI: 10.1029/2009EO030002. N. Oreskes, “Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,” Science Vol. 306 no. 5702, p. 1686 (3 December 2004); DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618. . So we have seven peer-reviewed and published papers which use different techniques, published from 2004 to 2015, which show that the consensus among climate science papers is in excess of 97% and that there are a tiny number of dissenters who are making obviously incorrect statements. 1. You can argue with one paper which has not been reproduced. 2. It's harder to argue with a paper whose results have been reproduced. 3. And it's much harder to argue with multiple different methodologies which arrive at the same result. 4. In the case of climate scientists having a very STRONG COMMON AGREMENT or a consensus on the basics of anthropogenic climate change, consilience is extremely high.

There was a petition quickly put together signed by more than 30,000 scientists expressing denial and given a little more time could have been 100,000. As well, a number of Nobel Laureates and scientists of similar stature who have refuted the current models. If it is a contest between thousands of third-rate scientists and 4 Nobel Prize winners, I'll bet on the latter. Even one of the top climate scientists, very much in the mainstream, warned a younger colleague, "Don't put your model in a race with nature. It will lose this race: nature is too complex." BTW I spent many years as a scientist in a climate lab. I am not an outside observer.

This is related to Zionism plots but is a conflict higher than nations, it is a spiritual conflict. To understand the uppermost uber elites you have to understand hermeticism and the secret societies they exist in. We don't need to go deep into this for this discussion.

Yes, any scientist that was undecided (the majority of them) their votes were thrown out. So any scientist that doesn't know the answer to the question because we really don't know at this point, their votes didn't go into the calculation. You should also look into how the Green House Effect temperature rise was calculated for the Earth. They used the same formula for a common Green House with a flat bottom. The Earth is not Flat. That formula is completely invalid to use of a curved surface. In addition, it is well know that the data is manipulated too. This is coming straight from people who worked for the IPCC. It's all about money. It's all about scientists, Universities, and Government programs getting millions of dollars to continue the lie. Scientists also have no clue what the perfect CO2 levels are for the Earth. Everyone should be lucky we're not entering an Ice Age. That would be deadly.

Science isn't about consensus, it's about fact, when you look at any truly settled science, there's nobody arguing against it. You never find members of the science community arguing the earth isn't round, or gravity doesn't exist etc. yet with global warming there are lots of clearly intelligent members of the science community arguing against it, which means it clearly isn't settled. My stance on the subject and I'd guess the majority of "climate deniers" stance is simple........we shouldn't be shutting down or fighting against energy sources like coal or oil, effectively putting people out of work and rocketing energy prices upwards, literally destroying people's lives, based on science that isn't even close to settled or fully understood. Climate change activism is a rich mans game, a fight taken on by people who could lose their jobs and see energy prices multiplied 10 fold and not feel the effects, for us average folk, it's a fight we can't afford to lose, regardless of how many times we are accused of "denying science" "wanting dirty air and water" or "ruining the planet for our children"	UCgtfSbY-EAb7Sp3t9N_woIg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgtfSbY-EAb7Sp3t9N_woIg	1	UgzbsgnYpy119zruUfJ4AaABAg	Inisfad

You are quoting one of the early ones, but not the first, which was Naomi Oreskes, who cherry picked terms until she got one which she falsely claimed indicated a "consensus" among published works. The last one was by Cook, who released his results before all the data was even in - and several people he specifically named as supporting every aspect he did came out publicly and said "NO, WE DO NOT!"

Again, there are many others and when I find the website on Climate Skepticism I’ll post it but it’s been a while since I read up on this topic. Climate Change is undeniably being used as a blunt object to bludgeon people into submission. It does not encourage debate, dissent or free thought. It starts all ‘debate ‘ by assuming it’s own premise. I do NOT trust that. So I am very skeptical of the whole Alarmist movement. There’s entire lists of projections these scientists have made, predictions, that have never happened. Let’s not forget New York City was supposed to be under water by now. And AOC says we will all be dead in 12 years. Yeah right. I reserve the right to be very very skeptical and highly amused by the fools who hysterically embrace this movement’s babble.

I've read many, by a wide range of scientists. Not all working for same place. The problem many have with what you just uploaded is just how much trust you put in the SPECIFIC organizations and scientists you are talking about. I'm not so paranoid that I'm saying don't trust scientists, but let's put it mildly: Global Warming and Climate Change is big business. Lots of people in gov are using it to make money and implement societal control. And many journalists are started to investigate these things and find that a number of scientists working for big name organizations, funded by government as a huge number of them are corrupt and giving opinion for profit ( most famously in Climategate)....there is correlation also in the medical field for example the APA has been indicted in numerous scandals regarding the misuse of gov funding, taking money and bribes so they would declare certain medication safe, intentionally giving wrong diagnosis, also you can point to Transgenderism which is no long listed as Gender Dysporia. Transgenderism is a perfect example of how Political Correctness has twisted and bent the sciences to conform to a political and social belief. I see the same exact people championing both causes. Using both causes to control. Blindly stating facts and using alarmism to silence others even as their 'facts' are debunked by logic or science. Also, as you can see with 'Climategate' BOTH issues are incredibly biased in their approach to what is fact. Neither suffers dissenting opinions. Climate change skeptics are literal pariahs in their field. The interesting thing is that very few deny the climate is changing but merely disagree that humans are the primary cause. In the end, I stand by what I said, the website if I can find it again was incredibly well-researched in regards to their findings and research on the supposed 97%. You copy and pasted something someone else researched which I would then have to go and research myself to even see if it was true. Go on Google and just type in Top Ten or 15 or whatever Top Scientists who are Climate Change Skeptics. There are a number of top, independent minds who do not bow their heads and worship at the alter of Political Correctness and Gov Control. Sadly, they are pariahs in their field and the media doesn't give them the time of day. Climate Change is real sure. But the concept that man, who has only been engaged in radical industrial construction for little of 100 years, has made such an impact in that short time, is absurd and I agree with the many scientists I have listened to who are rightly skeptical of this Fake Threat which is being used to control country's industry and econimies. That's the goal. Read the Green New Deal. AOC went and read the same crap you do and this is what came out the other end. Garbage.

In science you are supposed to try and disprove your hypothesis and theory and if you can even in the slightest bit then it is wrong. Tell me how many of your climatological theories ended up passing justa cursory test or how many of the predictions in the last 100 years have come true? None So if everyone of the predicted numbers doesn't match real world measurements then it is false.

"About John Cook Skeptical Science was created and maintained by John Cook, a research assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University. John co-authored the college textbooks Climate Change: Examining the Facts with Weber State University professor Daniel Bedford. He was also a coauthor of the textbook Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis and the book Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand. "In 2013, he lead-authored an award-winning paper analyzing the scientific consensus on climate change that has been highlighted by President Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. In 2015, he developed a Massive Open Online Course on climate science denial with the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland (see a full list of his scholarly publications). "There is no funding to maintain Skeptical Science other than Paypal donations - it's run at personal expense. John Cook has no affiliations with any political organisations or groups. " ----------------------------------------- There is really a COMMON OVERWHELMING AGREEMENT or consensus on global warming in the Scientific Community, actively Working on / Studying this phenominon / or who had been working in these fields from EVERY NATION ON EARTH ? ( ( ( I attend an evangelical church in Milwaukee, and 8 scientists in non-climatology fields, have NEVER spoken to any Scientist in ANY field that denys largely Human causation of Global Warming & the threatening climate changes it is causing. ) ) ) .

It's all about the economy. Economic growth is what keeps us alive and not fighting over resources. Most people would say that we need air and water.

Out of 100% polled I believe it was 63% who responded by saying they didn’t have adequate facts to say whether human beings cause climate change. So of the 37% who felt there was enough evidence to make a claim, 97% of that 37% claimed human action causes climate change. I’m at work I wish I could post the source, but look it up and dig beyond the headlines. They are manipulating scientists assertions to support their lies.

Question: is there any man made influence of climate in addition to the natural forces at play for millions of years. Total climate pattern = Natural climate pattern + human influence pattern In my lifetime, the natural influences on planetary climate have been elucidated one by one, starting with the really obvious and regularly periodic ones and adducing bit by bit the more long term ones and the not previously expected ones. This presentation is a good example of how real climate scientists are fine tuning the understanding of the natural climate variability and the influences that are significant and demonstrable. As each new influence is studied, the human contribution as calculated by the models must be seen to be less and less. This presentation shows that neglected natural forces have wrongly been attributed to human activity.

I think that 50% of the general public is smart enough to fully grasp the concepts in the clear and concise way you present the information. This is very important because the climate change or global warming message is lost on those capable of logical thinking. For good reason I think. When in fact the toxicity of our planet is the true problem with many forms of pollution. By using a false premise global warming and taxing people on this false premise. People loose faith in the governments objectivity and completely then disregard our pollution on the environment (seen) and our biosphere.

Like I said, you do you man. Absolutely no reason to get riled up. You can wait for Potholer's video as I'm sure he will spend significantly more time in responding to the claims made in this video than I am willing to. On second thought, I'll leave with you a little teaser though. Unfortunately it would seem you have not read up on Arctic Amplification or if you have, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you just forgot to mention it in this video. (Though it's also possible it didn't fit in with your narrative so you just chose to ignore it). If you haven't figure it out by now, the part of your video that I am referring to is the snow cover. In the literature, it is mentioned over and over and over again how spring snow cover is decreasing while snow cover is exhibiting a neutral to positive trend in the winter months. Why? I won't ruin the fun here and none of you have to trust me, just read up on literature concerning Arctic Amplification and you will have your answer. Data selection absolutely does matter, but this is a two way street Ben. And that's just one "fatal flaw" in your video that stuck out to me. Have a nice day :)	UCvBn2-0woT0Htnu2o3tmM-Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBn2-0woT0Htnu2o3tmM-Q	1	UgxUvBM6JwkR4DdR8_l4AaABAg	Henrik

I therefore readily appreciate this contribution to breaking up that dis-eased monoculture. <br /><br />However, there is still a fatal flaw in your approximation. <br /><br />It shows up in your first slide: Nature vs. humans. <br /><br />Last time I checked, humans were PART of Nature. <br /><br />Could it be that “we” have been misunderstanding the potential human contribution at least as radically as “we” have misunderstood the contribution of the Nature of the contribution of the Sun and other radiation sources (cosmic rays) from afar?<br /><br />For example: as far as I am aware, science has not even begun to approach the potential impacts of the electromagnetic field generated by the human heart.<br /><br />It might seem obvious that such “small”, “weak” fields could not possibly impact the overall behavior of the Earth’s electromagnetic/climate system. <br /><br />However, that may well be an erroneous assumption. The assumption that what the hominid body is naturally inclined to perceive as “bigger” must surely equal stronger has turned out be false in many areas of science already. Why could it not be false in this one?<br /><br />And do “we” know enough to know how the interplay of the electromagnetic fields generated by approximately 7.6 billion individual human hearts might combine to impact the electromagnetic/climate system of the planet as a whole?<br /><br />Since science here has not yet gained the capacity to evaluate the synergistic effects of the various pesticides we routinely apply, isn’t it reasonable to assume it has not yet developed the ability to analyze something as complex as the effects of human heart electromagnetic fields and the fields of the rest of Nature?<br /><br />I think this is reasonable, unless you want to posit that malicious aliens do, in fact, already have the scientific acumen to evaluate such astonishingly complex fields and their effects, but are deliberately concealing this superior know-how from the sheeple. That might be, for all I know; I’m not in a position to debate this supposition.<br /><br />I am in a position to know that science posited on the premise that human beings are separate from Nature is foundationally flawed.<br /><br />I am also in a position to know that science that insists that humans are not part of Nature innately serves to perpetuate the widespread human perception that we are caught forever between a rock and a hard place. We are destined to exist always at the mercy of vast forces beyond our mastery—or to submit to those among us who are content to substitute control for mastery. <br /><br />Thanks, I’ve had enough of that. Substituting a new group of High Priests of Scientific Supremacy for the old group will not satisfy me. Coke vs. Pepsi is not the only choice available here; no matter how much some insist that we must buy THEIR brand, some of us will forever prefer Water.<br /><br />I sincerely hope you are enjoying your 15 minutes of fame, Mr. Davidson. For this scientist says that none of you cola purveyors will ultimately prevail here, no matter how much you insist that surely, your reign must continue forever! Or, at least until the Earth is, for your purposes, utterly destroyed by anyone of the catastrophic events you delight in predicting for us.<br /><br />Perhaps it’s all a projection, Mr. Davidson. <br /><br />Perhaps the myriad totalizing catastrophes you see as inevitable for all are only an outpicturing of the evolutionary situation of those who stubbornly persist in acting as if humans are unNatural.

There is far more evidence the Bible is genuine than not; people will believe or deny what they will regardless. The Bible teaches God will restore earth to the conditions he originally intended, after the end of this satanic system in the near future. No doubt mans behavior is destructive. No doubt the earth goes through natural changes. I cannot say for certain the means to an end our creator has in mind. He does promise the entire earth will be harmonious and able to support billions, even mentions the deserts blossoming and lush for instance. I DO have faith he will keep his promises, remove all evil influence, make a peaceful perfect paradise home for meek God fearing persons. Psalms 37, Isaiah 35. Help finding answers in your own bible is available for free at <a href="http://jw.org/">JW.org</a>. We are all caught up in a universal issue raised long ago by Gods enemies that MUST be resolved once for all time. This time period is at its end. We live in the most important time in mans history.

UgyiZ8nUklyJKXU3iQx4AaABAg	2	2	2019-02-27 13:39:09	Robert Callaghan	<b>Sciencing Mother Earth</b><br />Pole flips have happened in as little as 200 years. The confusion over how long it takes likely lies in the fact that earth develops into as many a five poles at one time during the flipping process, taking as little as one or two decades to pass overhead. At times they may linger. This skewers geo data. I remember a claim from 2007 saying poles flipped in as little as 4 years. The jury is out. Even now satellites are shut down over the south Atlantic to protect their circuits. The other problem is lower tropospheric ozone depletion. Both open surface life to radiation exposure.<br /><br />I believe there is a magnetic shear zone under the South African craton and a subterranean low pressure magnetic zone beneath Canada. Earth&#39;s polar plates are rebounding and volcanoes are extremely sensitive to glacial melt and sea level rise. Even groundwater depletion shows up as low pressure gravity zones. Rebounding plates likely rock the cratons and disturb magma flows and may accelerate magnetic flux. I really don&#39;t know. I just make this shit up. But I imagine all the extra radiation has ecological and even climate implications.<br /><br />Scientists believe that Earth’s magnetic field shifted in only a couple hundred years. <br /><a href="https://bgr.com/2018/08/22/polarity-flip-earth-magnetic-field/">https://bgr.com/2018/08/22/polarity-flip-earth-magnetic-field/</a> <br /><br />Earth’s last magnetic reversal took less than 100 years<br /><a href="https://earthsky.org/earth/earths-magnetic-field-could-flip-within-a-human-lifetime">https://earthsky.org/earth/earths-magnetic-field-could-flip-within-a-human-lifetime</a><br /><br />In geological time, Gaia is entering menopause. It spins slower, It&#39;s getting wider around the middle, tilting and maybe wobbling a bit, rebounding up at the poles, low on magnetic charm, drying up in the mainlands, being gouged on the coasts, and popping out in volcanoes while having severe hot flashes. Imagine a falling droplet of water pulsating and you&#39;ll get the picture. Having slept with a menopausal woman, I can tell you our rest is in trouble. <br />☆☆☆<br /><br /><br /><b>MALE STERILIZATION AND FEMINIZATION IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD!</b><br />PFAS = male infertility + smaller penis size<br /><a href="http://www.michiganradio.org/post/pfas-chemicals-can-potentially-cause-male-infertility-and-smaller-penis-size">http://www.michiganradio.org/post/pfas-chemicals-can-potentially-cause-male-infertility-and-smaller-penis-size</a><br />PFAS = Most western men will be infertile by 2060<br /><a href="https://www.indy100.com/article/men-infertile-2060-science-us-europe-australia-new-zealand-8025861">https://www.indy100.com/article/men-infertile-2060-science-us-europe-australia-new-zealand-8025861</a><br />PFAS = Forever Chemicals in Drinking Water<br /><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/epa-blasted-failing-set-drinking-water-limits-forever-chemicals">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/epa-blasted-failing-set-drinking-water-limits-forever-chemicals</a><br /><br /><b>Male Feminisation:</b><br /><a href="https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2018/12/29/unfinished-business/">https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2018/12/29/unfinished-business/</a><br /><br />The end of the world is the end of the world.<br />Never trust a priest or a physicist.

How many other S0 subscribers were not made aware of this presentation being released? Couple this with the disingenuous views vs. comments in the YouTube app and I&#39;m beginning to wonder if perhaps some skulduggery is afoot.

What are the technical details of short term drops in Total Solar Irradiance? Are they the passage of sunspots - as Dr. Kopp, who supervises SORCE data, says - or are they flares? How long do flares endure? What do those peaks in x-rays look like in terms of forcing? Are they less than 10^-3 w/m^2? What's your baseline? Ben does not show the GOES data from these points.

This industry-disrupting trend comes down to dollars and cents, as the cost of renewable energy plumets below fossil fuel generation. Across the U.S., renewable energy is beating KILLER coal Electric on cost: The price to build new wind and solar has fallen below the cost of simply running existing coal-fired power plants in Red and Blue states. . For example, Colorado’s Xcel will retire 660 megawatts (MW) of coal capacity ahead of schedule in favor of renewable sources and battery storage, and reduce costs in the process. Midwestern utility MidAmerican will be the first utility to reach 100% renewable energy by 2020 without increasing customer rates, and Indiana’s NIPSCO will replace 1.8 gigawatts (GW) of coal with wind and solar. . Lazard’s annual ... Cost of Energy (LCOE) analysis reports solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind costs have dropped an extraordinary 88% and 69% since 2009, respectively. Meanwhile, coal and nuclear costs have increased by 9% and 23%, respectively. Even without accounting for current subsidies, renewable energy costs can be considerably lower than the marginal cost of conventional energy technologies. In other words, customers save money when utilities replace existing coal with wind or solar ." * * * * * "....Nov 11, 2018 at 9:43AM	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UgzBsaBhQj6VSao2mIp4AaABAg	Nietsewitch

Furthermore, the "toxic waste" is stored safely and the soviet union is not here to create another Chernobyl. The renewable except Hydro(which I can agree with) only works if the grid is their battery. Please consider that most renewable only policies in the EU have made countries such as Germany to completely rely on coal because they are only intermittent power sources. Cannot be used for industry(all except hydro). Well sure if you want too move all industry to PRC and make them suffer. Additionally, wind and solar does require deadly mining... see: cobalt mines in Africa and also uses rare metals.

Legendary constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe saw the thread, and said, “I’m with Seth Abramson here.” “Smarmy, slimy, smiling Jared Kushner of 666 Fifth Avenue is the beating heart of this unprecedentedly corrupt and deeply evil administration,” Tribe charged. Professor Tribe has taught at Harvard Law for 50 years and tried 36 cases before the United States Supreme Court. “He’ll eventually be exposed as an insatiably greedy Benedict Arnold,” Tribe predicted. Like Tribe, Abramson had harsh words for Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump. “I’m going to tell you now the chief thing I’ve learned from many months of research for my forthcoming book Proof of Conspiracy: Jared Kushner is now the greatest domestic danger to America,” Abramson argued. “And many former US government officials know for a fact that what I’ve just said is true.” “Whatever you think VP Dick Cheney was to President George W. Bush, take that, make it three times as sinister, make Bush ten times more sociopathic and a devout criminal, and make Cheney stupid, venal, and entirely dismissive of our rule of law and you get what Kushner is to Trump,” he continued. “Kushner is going to get us into a devastating war with Iran. Jared, singlehandedly. Jared, to make money for himself. I’ll say now that Jared more richly deserves to be in prison for the rest of his life than [Paul] Manafort, and Manafort richly deserves it,” Abramson argued. “That’s how bad this is.” “Whether you realize it or not, Kushner having top secret security clearance is the issue in American politics right now, as Trump circumventing our intelligence community to give his son-in-law that access is the shibboleth that made the current danger to America possible,” he said. “We need whistleblowers to blow their whistles now,” Abramson concluded.

The general mechanism is quite simple: we burn fossil fuels, this process releases carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere), which traps heat (which is attempting to escape to the cold of Space). There’s absolutely no doubt that the planet’s climate is getting hotter — decades’ worth of satellite and ground data clearly show (Alexander von Humboldt coined the term and defined 'CLIMATE CHANGE' in 1799) . There’s also overwhelming evidence that points to human activity as the main culprit. While there are natural factors which can cause an equal and even greater impact, human activity is essentially a smoking gun here: the evidence indicates that all the current global warming is caused by humans. . In this latest study, scientists carried out a statistical analysis of satellite climate data, identifying the anthropogenic fingerprints in climate change. . The analysis showed that humans are causing climate change to a confidence level of 5 sigma, the so-called gold standard of statistics — which translates a 99.9999% certainty. . In other words, there’s only a one-in-a-million chance that the pattern of atmospheric heating is not the result of human activity. . Science doesn’t really ever eliminate uncertainty — it just reduces it, and when the uncertainty reaches very low levels, then that’s essentially a scientific certainty. . This isn’t the first study to strongly conclude that humans are causing threatening climate change"	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UgzBsaBhQj6VSao2mIp4AaABAg	Nietsewitch

"doubling its CO2 usage faster all the time" WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY???? CO2 Usage? What are the doing HUFFING IT? ----------------------------------- India moves to rank 11 as a result of an improved performance in renewable energy, comparatively low levels of per capita emissions and a relatively ambitious mitigation target for 2030. “If all countries would follow the leaders, we would come a long way towards a well below 2°C pathway,” state the experts. The most polluting country on the planet: China, climbs to rank 33, reaching the group of the medium-performing countries for the first time. China performed relatively well regarding its emissions trend from 2014 to 2016, but emissions started to increase again recently. The overall high rating in the climate policy category reflects the government’s progress on regulating industrial emissions, building emissions and a successful renewable energy support scheme.

Countries such as China which has rivers turn red from pollution... India which has smog covering cities rated as being toxic by the government from India... Brazil which has human waste polluting the ocean for MILES... China which has been doubling its CO2 usage faster all the time.... India with many rivers flowing with human waste... and that does not even include all the countries which are clear cutting their forests and rain forests. The USA only has high CO2 usage because it's probably the wealthiest nation in the world where one family has 2 or 3 cars. Imagine what will happen to the CO2 in China once its 1.4 billion people and each Chinese family has its 2 or 3 cars?? So before you try convincing the US government on forcing all US citizens to use green cars... let's focus on the countries doing the most obvious pollution.

(THOSE CYCLES continue to this year...yet we are Warming NOT Cooling) . Hell, MUCH of the last 1000 years is Called the Little Ice Age, compounded by the Solar event called the Maunder Minimum in 1450-1540. . "ICE AGE" because of the FALLING temperatures for 8000 years. "LITTLE" because it ended. It ENDED ABRUPTLY in the late 1700's. WHY? Look for yourself: http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png . WHAT INTERRUPTED EARTH'S most powerful natural cycle? Since then, temperatures have been rising for OVER 2 CENTURIES!

Look: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/ . These are not ideas which have been invented by Al Gore or Modern Science. . 1799 Alexander von Humboldt studied, worried and postulated that Human Activites / pollution would CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE! Strip Mining entire mountain tops, Clear Cutting entire Forests, burning Coal/Peat/Wood/Oil, building huge cities which have their own climates . The First USE of " CLIMATE CHANGE " STILL in use today. . 1799 Thomas Jefferson also penned several letters to John Adams on observed climate changes which he stated was probably caused by man. . "1804 : Thomas Jefferson On Climate Change | Real Science . “A change in our climate is taking place very surely. Both heat and cold are becoming moderate within the memory of even the middle-aged, and snows are less frequent and less deep.” 1811 Science Tied Warming, Climate Changes directly to Human Activities & Industrialization. . 1856 "....a paper entitled “Circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays,” by Eunice Foote. In two brisk pages, Foote’s paper anticipated the revolution in climate science by experimentally demonstrating the effects of the sunlight on certain gases and theorizing how those gases would interact with Earth’s atmosphere for the first time. In a column of the September 1856 issue of Scientific American titled “Scientific Ladies,” Foote is praised for supporting her opinions with “practical experiments.” The writers noted: “this we are happy to say has been done by a lady.” . Foote’s research & paper demonstrated the interactions of Solar Energy on different atmospheric gasses through a SERIES of experiments...." ((Variations of those fundamental Experiments are critiqued/taught in nearly every 1st year science course on colleges and Universities around the world. .

Most climate alarmism, complete with corrupted data sets and email shenanigans and circular logic (warmer, colder, fiercer, milder it’s all AGW) is just thinly a veiled socioeconomic scheme. That’s plain; and I frankly don’t care, I just wish people would be honest about it. But the real crime is that it is diverting attention from the real issues facing humanity. I just yesterday explained to my kids why their grandkids will likely have no helium, no antibiotics, no elephants, possibly less or no vanilla, fewer or no whales, etc etc. I live next to a major river in North America and all the fish are poisonous to eat. The municipality where I live is a huge well-known cancer cluster. None of these things are driven by climate, which we aren’t affecting and couldn’t even if we wanted to no matter how many billions we waste in the process. All of them are driven by man’s activities, the attention to which might be a better use of those billions. Just imagine if that money was spent scooping the garbage patch up out of the Pacific Ocean. Or preserving the amazon rainforest while there’s still a little left. Or reforesting Madagascar. But no, we have to waste billions trying to figure out if co2 leads temp or follows it, trying to calculate methane forcing, and all the rest. It’s a damn shame what we are doing to ourselves as a species. Any day I expect the dolphins to fly out of the water saying “so long, and thanks for all the fish.” (Shout out to D.

I also believe in respecting our environment and the cycles of our planet need not to be needlessly polluted. Be a responsible citizen. However the we owe the Sun respect for it&#39;s place in our Galaxy, and in our solar system. The Climate is always changing and so is the Sun and it&#39;s behavior however both have dependable cycles. After our 3rd Ice age of course the planet is heating up. That&#39;s the meaning of coming out of an Ice age, 3rd. It generally heats up then it cycles back into an Ice Age again. These are dependable cycles. I like your perspective. That ration of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYoOcaqCzxo&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a>00000 of the earth to the Sun. So when the Sun cycles are tracked it clear why the Earth is doing what&#39;s it&#39;s doing, heating up. Because the Sun is hitting us harder in Solar Wind, Electron Density, Speed and Temperature. I expect that a CME will cause a major power outage in our future. It&#39;s a given. It&#39;s not that if it will happen but when it will happen. And Man had nothing to do with it! we just depend on it being hospitable to us. Call it a blessing. I do.	UCwqMQzjHn7tvtvepOD_-V8g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwqMQzjHn7tvtvepOD_-V8g	0

As we do not currently have the technology to affect the sun, the only thing we can do is to minimize our own  carbon emissions as well as other pollutants, and prepare for the consequences of living in a warmer climate. I hope we have the will and sufficient knowledge as well as technology to survive the coming global warming, which we are unlikely to be able to stop. I also hope that we can survive the likely chaos, conflicts, and maybe a coming ice-age, which is likely to occur beyond this current period of global warming. Regardless of actual cause, we will be facing a tough time for a minimum of the the next 10 years to maybe the next 10 generations.

Polar amplification implies that the centre of continents will see a below average rise, if anything, and we already know that the tropics do not rise at all if there is enough water around. The tropical temperature range is extraordinarily constant over long periods of time (millions of years).The "increase" so far claimed is detected as a rise in the temperature during winters, particularly a rise in the low temperature at night, not a rise in the daytime nor in summer. It is the "average" that is calculated, not the maxima. Check the number of days above 100ºF in Illinois, for example, as the impact of a global average rise, and the rise in the centre of the NA Continent.  The number is consistently trending down. As the solar cycle moves into a 210 year low, there is no expectation that "this summer" will see a higher average temperature than the long term average. We can use North America as an example. The temperatures in the centre of the continent have been dropping or steady when viewing the summer high average (dropping) or the winter highs (no change). The SE quarter of the continent has been cooling for 100 years (Atlanta GA etc). The current global temperature is still shy of what it was 800 years ago and significantly lower than it was 8-9000 years ago. (probably 2ºC lower at the moment). From available evidence, when it gets warmer by another 2ºC the rains return to the Sahara and Gobi Deserts due to the expansion of the Hadley cells, turning the deserts into vast grasslands, as they were previously. The huge underground aquifers in southern Libya and Algeria stopped filling 5000 years ago, showing that the climate, when warmer, was much more conducive to agriculture. Both of these young deserts are arguably "in the centre of continents".  I find this conclusive evidence that the proposed consequence of "hotter and drier" is incorrect and speculative and not in conformity with the available evidence. Even if contradictory evidence were to be found, it would still require explaining why when it was 2ºC warmer before, the same result (wetter central continental deserts) should not apply now.

The idea that the food is "harmed" is convenient speculation. First, the impact on nutrition content and micro-contents is affected by the soil. Just because a study shows some agricultural effect does not imply we cannot do anything about the soil conditions. The speculation about "reinforcing feedbacks" is not supported by any evidence at all. Zero. There is substantial evidence that there are negative feedbacks, particularly in the tropics.  The impact of 2 degrees of warming can easily be seen by looking at a city, say New York, and moving south until you come to a place that is 2 degrees on average warmer, which would be New Jersey. It you like, Washington DC. The idea that the entire ecosystem falls to pieces of a plant is move from NY to DC is silly. NY was under a kilometer of ice 15,000 years ago. Warming it 12 C did not cause any harm at all.Osama No.5, your baseline is 1750 and you claim warming. I choose 1250 A.D. and claim cooling.

In 2014, Myers and a team of researchers published the first large study on the topic in the scientific journal Nature. It examined crops grown in Japan, Australia, and the United States and found that as carbon dioxide levels increased, there was a measurable decrease — about 8% on average — in the amount of protein, iron, and zinc contained in those crops. This is not the main threat, though. Higher temperatures from increase CO2 and other greenhouse gasses increase temperature (we are arlready at 1.7ºC above the 1750 preindustrial baseline). The interior of large continents, where most of our food is grown, heat faster than the globe. This will lead to grain crops failing, and water shortages will further complicate things for plant growth. We have trigger dozens of reinforcing feedbacks that WILL bring us to deadly temperatures in an accelerating manner. I can explain more of that is you are interested, but since you specifically wanted to know about CO2 direct influencing plants, here is the study: Increasing CO2 threatens human nutrition: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13179 Climate myths: Higher CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels will boost plant growth and food production: "Predicting the world’s overall changes in food production in response to elevated CO2 is virtually impossible. Global production is expected to rise until the increase in local average temperatures exceeds 3°C, but then start to fall. In tropical and dry regions increases of just 1 to 2°C are expected to lead to falls in production. In marginal lands where water is the greatest constraint, which includes much of the developing world but also regions such as the western US, the losses may greatly exceed the gains." *snip* https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11655-climate-myths-higher-co2-levels-will-boost-plant-growth-and-food-production/	UC4WBfvmpxhSTv8MWavzZ_Gw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4WBfvmpxhSTv8MWavzZ_Gw	1	Ugz01LwFl0Z1vdMSgfl4AaABAg	ionacaddy

This video however has made my baloney indicators flip up. Anytime a person claims that they have information so simple that they can explain it to laypeople in a 20 minute video and yet they also claim that it is information that a vast number of scientists around the world have missed, it makes me question their bona fides. Or perhaps this person is suggesting a conspiracy among the scientific community? To suggest that the greater scientific community is ignoring the whole spectrum of radiation coming from the Sun except UV when they figure the Sun&#39;s input to the Earth is hardly believable. I have seen the figures on the watts/sq. meter of solar radiation and if it were all coming from just UV then we would be burning our skin in seconds from it which would be a tip-off to any scientist who stepped outside. To say that the scientists who study this subject have completely missed/ignored the whole rest of the solar spectrum is beyond belief for me. I&#39;d like to see some documentation for these claims, some peer review articles showing that only the UV portion of the spectrum is being included in solar radiation research.<br /><br />I looked at the 3 links provided but they only referred to this video information and gave no sources or corroboration of any of the claims. Some of this information seems to come from the Electric Universe theory which I have looked at and I think that it makes some good points and has a contribution to make, but as yet I have seen no peer reviewed articles detailing experiments that prove the validity of the Electric Universe theory. I will look into this further but I would like to see SO put up some real documentation to support the information in this video.

UgxiBYtti0uleuP3eYV4AaABAg	0	1	2019-02-27 03:10:56	earl decker	There many other factors that have not been mentioned or even known that effects climate change. The exchange of gases between the animal &amp; plant life on earth. Plants take in CO2 &amp; exhale O2 utilizing the carbon for structure building &amp; food building (fruits &amp; nuts). Animals on land &amp; in the oceans also utilize the O2  &amp; CO2  in the process of living. ALL the carbon used for fossil fuels originally came from the  earth&#39;s environment &amp; now the burning of these fuels are returning the carbon back into the environment . Just like the hydrological cycle the carbon cycle  recycles its self throughout the geological ages. Presently the earth is getting greener thanks to the added CO2 , increased precipitation &amp; temporary warming of many areas of the earth. Soon the deserts of the earth will once again return to their former states where animal life &amp; humans flourished. The forested areas in the N. Hemisphere  that once covered vast areas  before the glaciers advanced &amp; bulldozed them will again appear until the next ice age once again bulldozes them.. So the climate of the earth varies across the globe as well as during the seasonal changes. &amp; the seasons are opposite  in the Northern &amp; Southern  zones of the earth. When the earth absorbs more heat energy primarily the oceans at 70% of the earths surface more water is evaporated=more clouds=more precipitation= more cooling . So you see the earth has its own thermostat &amp; keeps the earth in balance with earth&#39;s biomass. There is no need for alarm about earth&#39;s climate in danger of going beyond the tolerances that the Creator planned, determined &amp; controls to keep ALL sustainable as long as the earth lasts. Read Gen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYoOcaqCzxo&amp;t=8m22s">8:22</a> for the proof. It is the unbelief  and greed of mankind that one needs to be aware &amp; place your faith &amp; hope in the God that still runs the Universe He created.

Now hopefully once people can digest and understand that information they can see that there’s no way anyone who handles the largest multinational corporations and labs in the world could possibly be that incompetent. Therefore there just be an agenda. The people that control the funding for those studies have always relied on a power differential based on occulted (hidden or secret) knowledge. Leveraging what they know against what everyone else doesn’t know. To maintain that status quo or increase the margin one would require not only gaining more knowledge but also keeping the masses they exploit in the dark as much as possible as the equation is more a ratio than sums. So therefore is it any stretch of the imagination that there is an agenda to not only sequester the knowledge that has been discovered to themselves but also suppressed and occulted from those they wish to disempower or rather steal power from? When will people understand this very basic principle of the master/slave relationship?	UC1tNtMM9YGBgyQRG4rxhOUA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1tNtMM9YGBgyQRG4rxhOUA	0

Rick Kooi : you clearly don’t know anything about solar and astrophysics science, therefore I highly doubt the scientific value of your other claims. Moreover, your approach is emotional and not scientific, typical for AGW church followers and doomsday scenario believers. A solar minimum is not just a moment, it’s a slowly creeping process that takes years. The average solar cycle takes 11 years (or 22 i go you take the whole magnetic sinus cycle), however some are stronger with more sun spots. These often go faster (like 9 or 10 years). Other cycles are weaker and last longer. Sometimes this stretches out so long that for decades there are no sunspots, like in the 17th century. The strongest cycles where in the second half of the 20th century. The solar-minimum you talked about in 2018 is actually going deeper and deeper. Check this excellent website if you want to really learn more about our main sequence star! http://www.solarham.net/index.htm By the way, talking about claims, what about an ice free Arctic Ocean in 2013, claimed by one of your AGW gods Gore?

Ha Ha Ha ! The joke is on you! Remember the Trump Tax Reform Debates... poor oil companies paying nearly 45% That is a lie! ignoring the TRILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORTS/SUBSIDIES/INFRASTRUCTURE ETC. they get. .... "....Between 2007 and 2012, the oil and gas industry paid an effective tax rate of almost 45 percent according to the American Petroleum Institute...". --------- LOOK: "....When we looked at the financial statements of 20 of the largest oil and gas companies, we found this group paid an average federal tax rate of 24 percent on its U.S. income. This was not surprising. It is no secret the federal tax code is riddled with broad exceptions and deductions allowing many industries to pay much less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate. In fact, one of the goals of tax reform is to lower the overall corporate rate by removing the system of distortive tax preferences that require companies to change their behavior in order to qualify. [MORE: Cartoons on Gas Prices] What was surprising, though, was the extent to which these companies were able to delay or defer the payment of the federal taxes they accrued. Most of the companies in our study deferred more than they actually paid. When the deferred taxes are subtracted from the amount these 20 companies owe, their average “current” tax rate drops to 11.7 percent. The independent oil and gas companies in the bottom half of our list, excluding the ones that recorded losses for the period, deferred almost all of the federal income taxes they accrued during the last five years, reporting an average current tax rate of just 3.7 percent..".

Why is a tiny little carbon tax so evil when you're also being taxed to death with fuel taxes? The truth is that governments have a huge stake in the oil and gas industry and that's why the oil and gas industry has them wrapped around their finger and why they have been allowed to suppress the development of more efficient vehicles, electric vehicles, etc, etc. You get hung up on NGO's who recognize that taxing pollution is a way to reduce pollution but you're okay with politicians taking money from oil companies in return for letting them destroy our environment for their gain. That's just wacked! The oil companies are trying to hold back the inevitable because they know it bad for their business. The next gold rush is in renewable energy and battery technology and they know it.

The environmentalists use the government to attempt to force their ideas on the rest of us. If all they did was spread their faith like the other religions did, I would have no qualms. They talk about how if we ALL did what they want, the world would be so much better. Or, if we don’t we are doomed. That’s a religion. When you take it up with the legislature, or tie up the courts because of it, you are no different than a theocrat. They are reinforcing their own illusion that they are better than others. They are trying to take power and choice away from the market place. They are trying to destroy the best thing in the history of the planet - capitalism (free enterprise - not mega corporatism). Everywhere they have tossed out capitalism, they have created an ecological disaster. - Everywhere -. When the environmentalists all start clamoring for consumption taxes over income taxes in order to more justly distribute the inherent costs of pollution and environmental damage, THEN I will accept that they are not anti-capitalism. Until then, they are just the latest flavor of totalitarian nonsense.	UCnyeyt3se8wSxzJ0B5pRV_g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnyeyt3se8wSxzJ0B5pRV_g	1	Ugw1dtORoiUN_hKIZzN4AaABAg	Yo Soy Kraken

Dont think about "folow the money", that is exactly what they want from us, to just split societies.If we are devided there is a risk that many people dies in oncomming extreme weather. We have spend time and lots of money on stuff that cant help us at all. We need to use solar energy, we need to take care of water we have, water amount is constant, no more no less, if we polute all water then we are fucked. We cannot change solar activitis, but we can change and adopt us. Solar panels is gonna be needed, for all powersource is gonna fail much more in the future. Sun is on the way to new solar minimum, if some predicitions are right, then this time sun is gonna be almost totaly without sun spots/flares. No sun spots no flares, means no electromagnetic activitiy from the sun that acctually protect whole solar system from cosmic rays. To much cosmic rayes can in theory strip us our atmosphere, in worst case. To still even think about CO2 and globalwarming and put a guilt for that on own people, makes me think of my kindergarden time when one kid tryed to blame me because he lost his toy car. Please compare dates of low peeks of solar activity and weather raports in same period. Im total amateur like i said, but facts are there. https://www.solen.info/solar/images/cycles23_24.png https://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats/sum96.htm If you look 1996, biggest snowstorms in USA in modern time, first time sence 1978 schools are forced to have closed. That year Sweden gets record middle summer temperature ever in history. My eglish is not so good but i hope that you understand what i trying to say here.

Guaranteed if you lived on the east coast or Midwest, during the winter and have only some type of solar energy, to keep you warm, you will all freeze to death, solar energies proper place will only be to supplement fossil fuels	UChkue-amf7lCPD6AnkvhNBA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChkue-amf7lCPD6AnkvhNBA	1	Ugw1dtORoiUN_hKIZzN4AaABAg	Yo Soy Kraken

IMO both he and Ben are brilliant, which is very frightening. Ben hasn't been misled as Adams has, but both have grossly underestimated the essential evil in the AGW scam, and have assumed its goal is protection of the environment, rather than the destruction of life on the planet. I've had the advantages of age (I've been researching the science and politics for decades now), decades of exposure to blatant AGW deception and censorship in communist CA, and a background in physical science that's made the brainwashing obvious. One of my sons, also a UCSB chemistry grad with a 'gifted' IQ, is as deluded as Scott Adams. It's a religion; and disputing it is blasphemy. I wish I knew how to reach those who believe that declining temperatures support the AGW scam, but we'll continue to speak the truth and hope that it's not entirely shadowbanned or censored.

The opposite is true; CO2 levels have shown no correlation with global temperature. CO2 is unrelated to particle; it's a molecule.. The fact that CO2 contains weak vibrational bonds that absorb and emit in the IR, like H2O, is unrelated to its effect in the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect was disproven years ago; greenhouses heat air by blocking air convention, not by internal reflection.

Using the same models , same data , follow each other steps in modeling the same data will yield consistently similar results. However most studies fail to address the presence of other lurking background and temporal factors that may help explain the variability and sudden change in climate reading via relying on mean averaged values . Much variations are not explained by most models as such predictions are subject to stay in schizophrenia with reality. The convention of explaining statistical models with &quot; accounting for other predictors or keeping them similar&quot; explains how they missed many relevant phantom factors	UCZ-i-t-58ZXKbG1HV7avKaQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ-i-t-58ZXKbG1HV7avKaQ	0

And I have that not just from do called &quot;deniers&#39;&quot; websites but an IPCC scientist as well who admitted to me he has some concerns with that as well. So, the extent of the warming if there really is a problem at all can&#39;t really be told given the flaws with the data. The scientist I mentioned and whose name I&#39;ll not reveal confirmed to me that the data collection and &quot;adjustment&quot; process is so flawed that the data cannot really tell us anything of use.

A heat balance only works out only if there if there were no losses. IPCC love to show heat balances and they forget that heat can convert into other types of energy. In particular, there is no law of heat conservation. We have a law of energy conservation, but not so for heat. This means, even if you introduce energy in terms of heat, that does not at all necessitate a heating. All phytosynthesis, all fossile fueles, the chemical energy to melt ice and vaporize water, all kinds of movements and the expansion of gases. They are all conversion of heat into other forms of energy which are used to create civilisation (e.g. to do work) as opposed to just creating entropy.

Thanks to sites like this, The Electric Universe Theory and The Thunderbolts Project, more and more people have come to a far better understanding of the true Nature of the Universe. Yet still, there are far too many people that follow the false assumptions of Academia, especially in Government. I have heard President Trump make statements that he does not believe in climate change, &#39;Go Trump&#39;. Let us all be vociferous to our Representatives and tell them the errors of their thinking. Being taxed for something the Sun does is &#39;Thievery&#39;.

When you allow the researchers to essentially only decide what items can be allowed in their sample (people only used items they allowed in, papers published, peer reviewed and 5+ such publications all peer reviewed by those in support of you own views and rejecting anything counter, such as Ben&#39;s presentation) and you further decide the authors &quot;answer&quot; to your question (when the author wasn&#39;t clear whether or not they believed AGW was real, the researcher decided for the author) then you get their fake 97%. <br /><br />Also, &quot;consensus on consensus&quot; did not provide the backup they wanted and showed less support of AGW than they stated.

Consider the Mayan Calendar, and the &quot;System&quot; passing through the Galactic Plane, twice each cycle, and coinciding with two equa-distant Micro Nova&#39;s. Are we now in a denser &quot;Radiation Cloud&quot; that will also increase the radiation, and &quot;Galactic Radiation Force&quot;, that has slammed into our Solar System every 12, 600/or so years? Seems to be a pattern that is the boss, and the Human effect really doesn&#39;t matter. It also seems as though the rising Co2 levels follows warming, not the other way around.

About 33 years ago, my brother in law, a geophysicist, was complaining about the measurements being done, regarding global warming. I can't tell you the technical reasons he was using, but he had written to the Academy of Science about it. I just remember hearing the conversation and, as q 14 year old, jumping in with "it doesn't matter, pollution is bad for many reasons. " I had seen the orange shampoo-colored air in Los Angeles a couple years earlier, and I lived around clean air. But, what do you think about Dr. Dunning's presentation, released last night? I'm feeling like, if Ben is giving credence to what he said, we can change our priorities and start organizing. Human nature includes the ability to cooperate for common goals. I find the pseudo-eugenicist argument of too many people to be incredibly stupid, beyond being ignorant. We need all of our resources. Especially if we're going to be pushed out of any official solutions, alleged by Dunning to have been developed by the elite. Even fusion. Well, it seems to me, now would be the time to organize, take that knowledge, from Dunning, and the rest, and stop being authoritarian followers parroting learned helplessness. Maybe its time to remove children from schools. How serious is the SO Community taking his presentation? This morning, I heard Ben call him "quirky". Actually, I'm getting a little pissed off about the situation and apparent irrational reaction I've seen so far. Hmm...

I saw the emails bragging about fiddling data, putting the real results in the backup papers in case it was investigated in the future as well as threats to scientists that didn&#39;t concur with the deception. Dr Jones&#39;s statement upon tenuring his resignation that &quot;People just don&#39;t understand what i&#39;m trying to do&quot; sounded very lame. Mostly because what he was trying to do was overwhelmingly obvious! I&#39;ve also got quite a few books by scientists totally debunking the whole concept along with the Hockey Stick Theory! God darn lying by omission is still lying!! Yes &amp; there was far higher &amp; lower temperatures in climate change as far back as we want to go. There was the late Middle Ages warming period which saw grapes documented as ripening in Scotland in winter!! etc etc etc Obviously this bunch of B/S is a particularly sore point with me..mostly because it&#39;s brainwashed people with no real knowledge other than what they are parroting from the corrupt IPCC scientists who cannot abide anyone differing with their opinions!!~	UCsJAbrXN2DWCVL4HH-9iLOQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsJAbrXN2DWCVL4HH-9iLOQ	0

This site posted them, and has a good list of other websites. Michael Mann couldn't find any dataset that produced the alarmist graph required to sell the agenda, so he combined data from different data sets. http://bishophill.squarespace.com/ You're right; if the model was correct, it would predict future observations. The major problem here, though, is the misunderstanding that the AGW scam is climate science or environmentalism; IPPC psyence' is restricted to the effects of anthropogenic CO2.

Flares barely register, though they can show in TSI data. Actually the dips in SORCE data have to do with the transit of sunspots, and the peaks with faculae.

An individual I recently talked to also suggested 'part replacement/replication engineering''. (Specifically dealing with humans, AI's, quantum computers). Also one could consider multiple copies that together make up the entity, best 2 out of 3 is what stands, right or wrong. But also, ask yourself the following questions: 1. Ask yourself: How exactly do galaxies form? The current narrative is that matter, via gravity, attracts other matter. 2. Ask yourself: How exactly do galaxies become spiral shaped in a cause and effect state of existence? At least one way would be orbital velocity of matter with at least gravity acting upon that matter would cause a spiral shape to occur. 3. Ask yourself: What does that mean for a solar system that exists in a spiral shaped galaxy in a cause and effect state of existence? Most probably that solar system would be getting pulled toward the galactic gravitational center. 4. Ask yourself: What does that mean for species that exist on a planet, that exists in a solar system, that exists in a spiral shaped galaxy, in a cause and effect state of existence? Most probably that if those species don't get off of that planet and out of that solar system, and probably out of that galaxy too one day, then they are all going to die and go extinct without any conscious entity being left from that planet to care they even ever existed at all in the first place, much less however they might have existed. They failed to consciously survive throughout all of future eternity. 5. Ask yourself: For those species who might make it out of the spiral shaped galaxy, (if it's even actually possible to do for many different reasons), where to go to next, how long to get there, how to safely land, and then, what's next? Hopefully they didn't land in another spiral shaped galaxy or a galaxy that would become spiral shaped one day, otherwise they would have to galaxy hop through the universe to stay alive, otherwise, they still die one day from something and go extinct with probably no conscious entity left to care they even ever existed at all in the first place. So, it appears we might have a long way to go to continue to consciously survive throughout all of future eternity. We need to get moving on this. That, or just enjoy life, die one day, forget it all, and be forgotten. Choices in life. Survive, die trying to survive, die not trying to survive. Two out of three though, we die. So, we either find a way to survive throughout all of future eternity, or we eventually die and go extinct. Or so it currently seems to me.

Increases in greenhouse gases such as CO2 cause global warming which is damaging to natural ecosystems and our present standard of living. No one is concerned with natural cycles of carbon, hydrogen or oxygen. Respiration is not a problem. Hydrogen fuel is not a problem, so long as it is produced without using fossil fuels.

I'm not arguing one side is more right than the other in their claims, but there is no point in this if you want to actually talk about the science instead of calling people frauds. So if he wanted a proper discussion his comments would be much more different. He links to a "real" solar scientist channel, supposedly, which has no actual name and can't provide a name.

This means that most of the heat producing radiation escapes it. About 8% of the available black body radiation is picked up by these "fingerprint" frequencies of CO2. Water Vapor (H2O): Very strong absorber in 5.5-7.0 μm range and > 27 μm. Water vapor in the atmosphere is also variable in time and space.Ozone (O3) : Absorbs strongly in the UV portion of the spectrum (short wavelengths) and is responsible for protecting us from damaging radiation that causes skin cancer. Water vapor is by far a much larger contributor to retained and absorbed heat than Co2. If you drive a hydrogen car you are creating water vapor and causing global warming. If you breath you contribute to global warming, you exhale more water vapor than co2, so dont breathe	UCPnSIjO4NJlBXJaCT7PZl1g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPnSIjO4NJlBXJaCT7PZl1g	1	UgwhNGNmBnxIHE2mamt4AaABAg	Suspicious0bservers

Just think, weather has only four variables to it's system and, yet, human meteorologists can't make a proper weather prediction until the weather system is pretty much on top of them. My guess, is that modeling such a 10 year climate model would much harder than modeling what two NFL football teams will enter the Super Bowl in ten years as well as what the score will be and who the winner will be. This is the natural variability of the Earth that the narrator is talking about. It is too volatile and complex for any mathematician to model out with any success.

UgwhNGNmBnxIHE2mamt4AaABAg.8rpOmFIbkM28rrWk34EJFU		7	2019-02-27 15:49:02	Charles Brightman	@Gary Sarela I myself am not a 'scientist' or have papers published in scientific journals, BUT utilizing what I do know and believe to be really true (in large part due to self studies), along with critical thinking skills, some things can be figured out as being most likely really true. For example, ask yourself the following questions: 1. Ask yourself: How exactly do galaxies form? The current narrative is that matter, via gravity, attracts other matter. 2. Ask yourself: How exactly do galaxies become spiral shaped in a cause and effect state of existence? At least one way would be orbital velocity of matter with at least gravity acting upon that matter would cause a spiral shape to occur. 3. Ask yourself: What does that mean for a solar system that exists in a spiral shaped galaxy in a cause and effect state of existence? Most probably that solar system would be getting pulled toward the galactic gravitational center. 4. Ask yourself: What does that mean for species that exist on a planet, that exists in a solar system, that exists in a spiral shaped galaxy, in a cause and effect state of existence? Most probably that if those species don't get off of that planet and out of that solar system, and probably out of that galaxy too one day, then they are all going to die and go extinct without any conscious entity being left from that planet to care they even ever existed at all in the first place, much less however they might have existed. They failed to consciously survive throughout all of future eternity. 5. Ask yourself: For those species who might make it out of the spiral shaped galaxy, (if it's even actually possible to do for many different reasons), where to go to next, how long to get there, how to safely land, and then, what's next? Hopefully they didn't land in another spiral shaped galaxy or a galaxy that would become spiral shaped one day, otherwise they would have to galaxy hop through the universe to stay alive, otherwise, they still die one day from something and go extinct with probably no conscious entity left to care they even ever existed at all in the first place. Now, I also know that I don't know what I don't know, and even what I know and believe to be really true maybe isn't, if a person studies the human brain one will find out a person can't even fully trust their own brain and mind, so I would be the first one to admit that I could be wrong. But then, some sort of actual evidence would be needed to show where I were wrong in my analysis and conclusions. Sure, being a rocket scientist might definitely help species survive beyond this Earth, solar system and galaxy, but one does not have to be a rocket scientist to figure certain things out, or even having any papers officially published. Reality is still reality and truth is still truth. When one becomes a sincere honest truth seeker, one can even better trust their inner instincts that way. But no matter what, it currently appears our true destiny is: * We are ALL going to die one day from something. * We are ALL going to forget everything we ever knew and experienced. * We are ALL going to be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place. Nature is our greatest ally in so far as Nature gives us life and a place to live it, AND Nature is also our greatest enemy that is going to take it all away.

Magnetic fields interacting with other magnetic fields (along with any electrical interactions as well), can cause things to occur. Edit: Also, later in the video, as the Earth's magnetic field weakens, more cosmic energy reaches further into the Earth's atmosphere and more energy reaches the surface of the Earth, both causing things to occur.

Because any global warming denier was rooted out of all institutions. <br />Why do &#39;they&#39; always want to say ... man is doing this? Because the answer is ... regulate man ... which opens up public funds .. taxes .. and whatever else they can squeeze out of us for a made up problem. <br />Utterly disingenuous science .... the vast majority of CO2 is generated from decaying biomass ... not people.<br />The oceans are currently cooling.<br />Notice that the sound bite is now ... climate change ... not global warming ... subtle change that most sheeple don&#39;t even realize. Now ..anything odd can be climate change ....and they&#39;ve convinced the sheeple that we are to blame.<br />The truth? Every 100,00/ years earth has 80,000 years of ice age ... then a 20,000 year &#39;summer&#39; ... we are 16,000 years into our summer ... so it&#39;s gonna get cold for a long time in the next few thousand years.<br />Winter is coming ... and it will stick around for long time ... so enjoy the summer.

Global warming was bullshit and nobody stepped up and said it was .. they just changed the narrative to "climate change" ... Voila ... That includes everything. What does it mean? Nothing. Climate is always changng. Sun calls the shots on weather ... inputs most of the energy ... fromrms strong or weak solar sheet ... Sun defines our weather mates. Not man.

Because the link you did pass me argues strongly for precisely the oppposite (i.e. it provided several links to peer-reviewed studies that show continuous ocean warming for most of the past 100 years. ) I suspect you sent this link by accident as it does not support your position but rather it provides strong evidence to the contary.

We’ve all directly experienced cooling for the last 24 months ... so perhaps for almost 5 years there has been no “global warming.” Academic assassination” eliminated all deniers of man-made global warming. Why? Man-made global warming means the answer is “regulate man” which can be profitable. Taxes … regulations and licenses … “clean” credits … We’ve been tricked by false data. There are two types: Old network of ground based temperature sensors positioned mostly in urban areas which have a natural upward temperature bias (concrete jungle holds heat). They have spotty coverage and poor coverage of ocean temperatures. This 2016 article suggest the upward bias in ground data: https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/hottest-year-on-record-claim-not-backed-up-by-the-data/ Satellite data: comprehensive and shows a sharp decline in average temperature for the from 2014 to 2016. The ground based data is often “corrected” later after the false headlines have run. Temperatures have Cooled for Two Years by All Accounts. Both data sets show cooler temps and satellite data shows a dramatic dip. You will also notice a subtle change in media coverage; it’s not “global warming” … it’s now “climate change” … and nobody is asking questions. If they admitted to global cooling for 5 years then we would ask what happened to the dire warnings about global warming and the C02 apocalypse? https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/04/26/global-temperatures-have-cooled-since-2016-heres-why-thats-normal/ While the article cites 2 years of cooling it does suggest temps will rise again in 2019 (I doubt they have and will do some research to update this info … but I think we’ve all experienced “colder” for a few years). https://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/if-global-warming-is-real-why-do-government-scientists-have-to-keep-cheating/ This article outlines a whistleblower scientist (no doubt ostracized and without a job now) brave enough to show the govt falsified temperature data upward for years. “They” will always try to profit from weather by blaming (and then regulating) man. If it’s not “man’s fault” then they can’t tax and regulate us … so that’s where they force the “science”. The earth gets hotter, then the earth gets colder in natural cycles. In fact, the earth is cool (ice age) for 80k out of every 100k yrs. We’re about 18k yrs into the 20k yr “summer” so enjoy the nice weather .. it’s gonna be cold for about 80,000 years or so pretty soon. Global warming? Nope. (this post and research is almost 2 yrs old … I’ll update research for the last 1-2 yrs but I bet even the land based sensors have measured drops the last two years … they just don't report it … )	UCMDviqNR4bXsLLXsKg4vLKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMDviqNR4bXsLLXsKg4vLKQ	1	Ugx3Xr6jBw6g6ADwlDl4AaABAg	Jens Hoekendijk

They could not be more mistaken. We must understand that most of the tech "giant" worker bees (mindless drones) and "guardians" of the information highway (useful idiots) are doing the bidding of globalist billionaires - who want Orwellian control of humanity, so as to ensure their continued dominance over the Earth and its inhabitants - that is how they "protect" their ill-gotten wealth. As always, follow the money. Its all about avarice and power - hence the need to conduct their "man-made global warming" gas-lighting psy-ops.

Maybe we are funding this to some extent? <br /><br />  Political aspirations, larger gov&#39;t in the name of technocracy / controlling co2 on a planet made up of carbon? If you wanted to control all resources in the name of a few people you could not create a better crisis to redistribute (manage in their words) the worlds resources. To control co2 you would have to control carbon and the deconstruction of carbon into co2 (manufacturing). Even tilling your crops creates co2.

Changing the retirement age requirements to allow for anyone to retire 24 hours after birth is the right thing to do. We need to tax those responsible for the 200 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) they produce annually!! The corporations and wealthy that are responsible for the world&#39;s volcanoes really need to be taught a lesson .

Let me attack AOC based on her DEEDS, not because she's different (and don't kid yourself, she ain't different from any other Democrap): Intelligence? How intelligent is it to make a claim the world will end in 12 years UNLESS we subscribe to her economy-busting Green New Deal? It's not intelligent, it's NEGLIGENT and IRRESPONSIBLE because it's a LIE. Please describe AOC's reasoning and logic for me. Do you view her scare tactics as reasonable or logical... Help me out here. Do you view her logic as spending $3500 on a pantsuit? How reasonable of her to want to dismantle DHS. That's SUPER smart! AOC's compassion ABOUNDS by LYING to the American people telling us ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS are living in concentration camps at our border! REALLY??? Pictures prove otherwise. Or is she compassionate by wanting to flood the US economy with ILLEGAL, UNSKILLED IMMIGRANTS FOR VOTES?? Before you opine, learn facts. She's an ignorant MORON who majored in International Relations and Economics, and it APPEARS she knows NOTHING ABOUT EITHER. No one with that degree is anti-Israel (whether you like them or not) and certainly wouldn't devise a Ponzi scheme described as the Green New Deal. Go back to high school, fool. And take your typical, liberal, "don't make fun because their different" LIKE YOU'RE THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE. You're treading heavily when you attack people's character here.

Have you watched any of Michael Shellenberger's presentations? The guy makes a great case for nuclear power after having been a very strong proponent of renewables. I really hate AOC's Socialist policies. Sure she stands up to the establishment but man that socialist extremism isn't my cup of tea. I voted 3rd party last election. People who tell you you're wasting your vote are pathetic. They can't win on policy so they try to bully people into conformity. Unfortunately that seems to be the core ideology of the Democrats these days. Clinton was the worst candidate in history. Her entire campaign was based on ignoring her dishonesty and saying Trump was worse than her. Lol. She's taken hundreds of millions from corporations and dictators all over the world. Her and bill have been very successful at monetizing their political offices. Corruption at a new level. I'd love to see more party choices. I think it would go along way to reducing corruption associated with the 2 party system also.

Granted they weren't on twitter. Or how about Bush Sr statements on climate change? Climate change is nothing new and is not in any way shape or from a left wing idea, or exclusive to left-wing ideology. People need to learn to separate science from politics, there are conservative methods to fixing climate change, check out the likes of Debbie Dooley, a former tea party member and what she has to say on the issue.

At the onset the average global temperature dropped over a relatively short period of time from around 75° to around 50° And at the outset the global temperature rose over a relatively short period of time from 50° to 70°. The first 4 ice ages man did not exist on earth and the temperature rose. We are now on the trailing end of the 5th ice age so naturally the average global temperature is going to rise. How can anyone say that it is man made when this has occurred 4 times before man ever walked the earth. There were no carbon emissions during the first 4 ice ages, so what caused the temperature to rise then? The problem is that all of human existence has been during an ice age so we perceive the earth how it is now as its normal state. Well, what if in the earth's true normal state there is no ice present? The ice currently at the north and south poles are the remnants of the 5th ice age. Think about it, if the entire earth was covered in ice, what areas of ice would the sun melt last? The places furthest from the sun, the north and south poles. There are people out there trying to use global warming as a fear tactic to scare people into doing what they want.

B) The feared Grand Minimum ISN"T going happen this time. Cycle 24 died a death in 2018 and new spots for Cycle 25 have made an appearance. They know that they are from 25 because they are of reverse magnetic polarity to that of 24, a phenomenon which occurs at the end of one cycle and beginning of the next. So Cycle 25 is declared under way...No Grand Solar Minimum this time BUT..... if 25 is weak and a low count over the next eleven years, your GSM could well be on the cards.

"....the most striking feature of this early age of mammals is that it was almost unbelievably hot, so hot that around 50 million years ago there were crocodiles, palm trees, and sand tiger sharks in the Arctic Circle. On the other side of the blue-green orb, in waters that today would surround Antarctica, sea-surface temperatures might have topped an unthinkable 86 degrees Fahrenheit, with near-tropical forests on Antarctica itself. There were perhaps even sprawling, febrile dead zones spanning the tropics, too hot even for animal or plant life of any sort. This is what you get in an ancient atmosphere with around 1,000 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide. If this number sounds familiar, 1,000 ppm of CO2 is around what humanity is on pace to reach by the end of this century. That should be mildly concerning. ((More than Mildly Concerning)) “You put more CO2 in the atmosphere and you get more warming, that’s just super-simple physics that we figured out in the 19th century,” says David Naafs, an organic geochemist at the University of Bristol. “But exactly how much it will warm by the end of the century, we don’t know. Based on our research of these ancient climates, though, it’s probably more than we thought.” Last week, Naafs and colleagues released a study in Nature Geoscience that reconstructs temperatures on land during this ancient high-CO2 hothouse of the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs—the sweltering launch to the age of mammals. And the temperatures they unearthed are unsurprisingly scorching...." .

If it was true it would just show that the IPCC scientists screwed up, if the math was easy everyone would do it.

I know everything you just said except I was off on the exact temp. But my point was the IPCC must have sunlight at -18 for their math to work out. And knowing the radiant heat of the sun shows they are purposefully misleading in the modeling.

The sun's radiation cooks the unprotected side of the moon that's facing the sun, heating it up to around 270 degrees F, but on the opposite side that gets no radiation it can cool up to -280 degrees F. To the point about the IPCC -18 degrees F sunlight. I can't find anything about it would you mind sharing your source of that?

Popper gave a name to “theories” like this: pseudoscience.<br /><br />The burden of proof still remains with the alarmist.

Like the Atom , and many other things. We back our facts by experimentation. Like chemistry. You can mix certain chemicals and get the same results each time. and it can be replicated over and over Again. and that becomes scientific fact. But if it can't be proven through experimentation then it's not scientific fact. even if you can do it mathematically. it is not scientific fact till it can be proven through some form of experimentation. and be observed in the lab over and over again same results. This is why science today physics, and others have lost their way. Because they've gotten away from experimentation. instead they use computer models. and math instead of experimentation. that can be replicated. And that's huge. Science is not a democracy! it's not a whole bunch of scientist getting together and raise their hands agreeing to something. It is experimentation to prove a fact and through experimentation over and over again it becomes a fact! but if you can't do that then it's not a fact. computer models can not produce facts. That's why climate change it's not a factual science. And 97% of the scientist I have not spoken with, nor interviewed them. and nor have you. So I have no idea what they really think. Even if they did agree doesn't mean it's right or correct. Just today there's a report out saying the ice caps are now growing again and more snow and more ice is growing the Antarctica and in the North Pole so the Ice Age idea or the climate change idea is not working now again. And that's the report just today. and that's from NASA observing the ice growing. that's a factual fact so that goes against 97% of scientist you just mentioned. And it's not computer generated. Most of those scientist you mentioned are from China India and places like that who are not the same and scientist from the United States India and China would love to take over all the fossil fuels in the world and it's a plot to do just that.

What kind of dadaist would define ‘a lying sack of 💩’ as ‘anybody claiming something as incredibly complex as planetary climate is “settled“ ’? Anyway... Nobody claims that climate as a whole is a settled subject. If that were the case, there would be no need for further research (like there is no more research into classical gravity). What is settled is that human-generated CO₂ causes a significant greenhouse effect, and that we can expect this to warm the Earth by a worrying amount. That doesn't mean there aren't other effects at work too, in fact for some we know quite certain that they are really important too (in particular the slow&steady rise of solar activity over its lifetime, and the Milankovich orbital forcing). Other effects, energetic particles and whatnot, _may_ be relevant too, I don't know – the point is, if you think they are so important you should provide a quantitative physics explanation. That might be quite interesting, but even if you find such an effect to have a big influence (which seems unlikely since the historical record doesn't show any warming as steep&sudden as we're experiencing right now) then this changes little about the conclusion that CO₂ is a problem too.

You read the entire response and your conclusion is climascam is falsifiable ... PERIOD? Really? And you follow up that THIS video has stuff that cannot be measured? The fact that you are an ignorant troll is clear, the science in this video is not. The presentation was not trying to prove the existence of these phenomena, fool, these are things that are discussed all the time (if I remember the references he was making ... he had quite a few) ... like 600 papers (?). This video is a simplistic explanation of the FACT that the climascam frauds are INTENTIONALLY disregarding KNOWN science since it completely obliterates the effect they desperately are trying to create: that CO2 causes all the problems. Now, IF you seriously are ignorant enough to believe climascam IS in fact falsifiable ... then the video completely obliterated it ... he proved that KNOWN phenomenon EASILY debunks the climascam conclusions about CO2. Obviously tons of other science has torn apart the basic fundamentals of the scam ... -CO2 does NOT have a POSITIVE exponential feedback; -the greenhouse they created is not REMOTELY related to any measured effect, either a real glass box or the global atmosphere - none of the goofy explanations for ‘hiding’ the warming exist, - increases in CO2 have a BENEFICIAL effect AND warming has improved conditions for plants and animals alike, including humans Now, I will even clue you in on how to make your argument: show that the phenomenon described herein do NOT have the effect.

It is the climate scientists who have a clear, falsifiable theory. The critics like SuspiciousObservers with this video however only have an unspecific mish-mash of hypothetical effects, which allegedly all need to be considered. Well, _that's_ unfalsifiable, because some of these effects can't even be measured. They _might_ influence the climate, sure, but if we have no reliable way of telling then this is not scientific and can be disregarded under Occam's Razor.

Testing can support a theory but not prove that it is "true." A theory can only be proven as "false" through testing. Thus ... settled science is not science since it defies a basic premise of the scientific method. This is a real problem in science today since theories can survive despite "anomalies". Anomalies, in fact, suggest the "hidden science" in many areas. In physics, for example, the majority of all mass and energy in the Universe (dark energy and dark matter) has been "made up" to prop up the broken theories EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NEVER DETECTED DARK ENERGY OR DARK MATTER. If my theory is that magical gravity fairies exist and they fly around and make everything "just right" while expanding the universe at light speed .. this theory has as much validity as dark energy and dark matter .. sad. Apparently this is more acceptable than thinking that maybe the theories in physics need to be reevaluated instead. This is the problem with 'settled science' .. no such thing.

The idea of astronomically-determined climate cycles driving the major glacial-interglacial fluctuations of the last 2-3 million years (aka “The Ice Age”) seemed now to be widely accepted by the scientific community. What I did not realize at that time was that in the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere, the young science of climatology had already been targeted for exploitation and co-option because it provided a useful means of advancing political-economic objectives. Think tanks such as “The Report from Iron Mountain” and the “Club of Rome,” political bodies such as the United Nations, various branches of military/intelligence, and Wall Street corporations had, by then, decided that climate “research” could be used to advance “globalist” political-economic objectives. Indeed, the “Report From Iron Mountain" concluded that the "perception" of a looming environmental catastrophe could be used as a substitue for war in the future as the organizing principle of society: https://naturalclimatechange.us/origin-of-agw-fraud/ Ben may not realize that the concept of solar control of the earth's climate was acknowledged before he was born, and has been superseded by globalist political policy that mimics science.

There have been many surveys since John Cook's, but the essential fact that physical science has no dependence on opinion labels them all as political disinformation. All surveys are a distraction from the bogus science that can't predict climate. It's frightening to see how easily the public has been misled. The sun controls the earth's climate, and it's impossible for mankind to either control solar cycles or or for the PTB to control humans through solar cycles or to make a $ on them. I'm encouraged that Tony Heller is speaking truth in his utube videos these days, and I think the troll arguments have gotten a little worn through the years. A current problem, in the event that the consensus psyop is reactivated, is that many years of denying funding to honest scientists and blocking their ability to publish any research they're able to conduct with their funding cut through the PC censorship used by academic journals who are funded by US-UN-NWO sources. This has skewed recent research towards AGW-alarmism, since they're the only ones who can do research and publish it.

IIRC, the survey was sent to several thousand scientists, of which only a handful replied. Of the small number of respondents 97% indicated they believe humans were influencing climate change to some extent. I think this survey was the initial genesis of this bogus claim. It's about as accurate as looking at the results of some Internet poll. The major problem with the 97% claim, is they don't identify the "of what". How many scientists were asked, what are their credentials, are they even qualified to make an assertion, how many of the respondents are funded by government research into AGW/CC, etc.	UCRbxVkwKDzASq6jL3r2xEmg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRbxVkwKDzASq6jL3r2xEmg	1	Ugz1irfcEtAPGCSjVxl4AaABAg	Peter

It’s OK to be serious, but some things are just funny. If you can’t laugh at them—or yourself, for that matter—you’re not doing science, you’re doing ideology. Anyway, reading you, someone could get the idea we’ll be dead, and gone, in 12 years. Maybe it’ll help if we give AOC and Ed Markey 100 trillion dollars next month, do you think? Take a look at Albert Einstein, if you don’t believe me:: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=albert+Einstein+photos&t=ipad&ia=images&iax=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Fi2.kym-cdn.com%2Fentries%2Ficons%2Foriginal%2F000%2F015%2F725%2Furl-3-10tjli1.jpeg	UCfpI5uk-WiGmGuJSHnOWYZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfpI5uk-WiGmGuJSHnOWYZA	1	UgyngAvEJn2B635yf394AaABAg	some dude

The platform has built in buffering of numbers because of race conditions inherit in counting thousands/millions of people watching and liking. So each server being used counts up watches/likes/dislikes and delays posting them to counteract any race conditions. There are millions of videos being served any second - its impossible to show a realtime view of like/dislike/count.

Sure they complain. make threats, talk talk talk etc.. but the "bad" things keep seeping in, like a pounding rain we just except as "life". All the while searching for the "thing" that will change everything. Politicians, leaders, celebrities, "elites", and so on, being the Godless wretches they are, they seek personal gain and pleasure, and will hide in the mountains and "hope for the best". If they can be bothered to "do anything".	UCFXjCOOjtLPl-3nShF8ikDg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFXjCOOjtLPl-3nShF8ikDg	1	UgydokmGA4j2NUXJCaR4AaABAg	Monkey Pooh

There's no guarantee that the nova cycle will continue. Perhaps it shot it's last gasp with the last one. Who knows? But what we do know is that the reset has happened more than once, and the last one caused humanity to lose its memory. Preparation as a nation to store up for years of famine as Joseph told Pharaoh. To survive such a catastrophe as befell the earth last time around meant living in the safest area. The Americas, North and South, felt the brunt of the blast, eliminating all large land animals. The only places big ones survived was Africa and parts of Asia. We see the tunnels and caves and we know people survived, obviously. But why the tremendous amnesia? The cataclysm had to have been monumental. And it has happened at least 4 times in the history of humanity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjbb0enb7CY	UC0suGYvOVkrVhjwrBoTo5Yw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0suGYvOVkrVhjwrBoTo5Yw	1	UgydokmGA4j2NUXJCaR4AaABAg	Monkey Pooh

Maybe they are hoping the nuclear material will be buried under dozens of meters of mud, or diluted in the oceans. In case you are wondering about that last one the Fukishima disaster, as bad as it was, barely made a small blip in the background radiation of the Pacific Ocean because the oceans are so vast. So if you figure a larger blip for all of the reactors that would get washed away, the greatest majority of that would decay in a year or two, with the end result being marginal compared to the greater calamity. My guess is that someone somewhere decided that the small amount of radiation they would need to deal with a few years later is a lot less of a problem than letting on to the rest of us that something bad is about to happen.

Second, there is a finite amout to radioactive output...that amount has lessened with modern advancement to nuclear structures since the Chernobyl incident. Third, the thing everyone is afraid off is naturally occurring...just not in the concentrations occurring at a man made structure. Four, dilution is the solution to pollution. Our plants fail "safe"...reaction stops. Period. There may be fall out, however the exaggerations you see and read about are exactly that...exacerbated fear mongering nonsense in most, if not all, cases. I have concerns...everyone should have reasonable concerns because code compliance set out by the NRC is PERHAPS not being followed through to the extant it should be...BUT...and it's a BIG BUT... Chernobyl was a disaster because there was not international compliance and the Russians built an unsustainable structure not understanding what they were mimicking. It will not happen again...there are NO plants in operation today built like that one was. The disaster that befell Japan would not have occured had they retrofitted that plant (like they said they had) with the upgrade recommendations. I am certain that this incident (well over hyped by every fear mongering profiteer on the inter webs) has lead to an international compliance initiative of inspection and renovations. Please don't worry.	UCE0S_YpX2Ez6S6P03VauLkg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE0S_YpX2Ez6S6P03VauLkg	1	UgydokmGA4j2NUXJCaR4AaABAg	Monkey Pooh

Hive minds receiving their orders from one central "Brain", just like in those old movies. The pyramid builders understood this technology, and all of us who say they'll refuse to have micro-chips inside will be faced with the situation that humanity is at stake. Most will succumb. Thing is, if we do, and the prophecy materializes, those who survive will become slaves for the next rulers. Is that the prize for defeating nature ? Black magic at it's finest. Lose-Lose.
