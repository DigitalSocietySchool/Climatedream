It appears cold weather that kills people is the emotional motivator for Lord Moncton, and the blame is shifted from government policy of neglect (yes Maggie Thatcher wielded a budgetary knife on that) to any/all Green parties that suggest that avoiding catastrophic global warming would be a noble objective. There were a <b>lot</b> of accusations against a <b>lot</b> of people which don&#39;t bear individual assessment. Summary : grumpy self-important denialist believes himself, roams his manor seeking warmth and comfort, unable to fathom consequences of actions. Thatcher was right about it being essential to get priorities right on the major things. misinformation such as Lord Moncton leads to inactivity. What is the cost of 30 years inactivity? Qualified people on the front lines dealing with a warming climate think differently: <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/worldtoday/former-fire-chiefs-escalate-call-for-action-on-climate-change/11703684">https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/worldtoday/former-fire-chiefs-escalate-call-for-action-on-climate-change/11703684</a>	UCYlGkhhe-6RLbQm1haO0srA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYlGkhhe-6RLbQm1haO0srA	0

We can tell the contents of added CO2 based on isotopic analysis. There are two stable and one unstable type of carbon, and we can "age" it based on the ratio of those three types. One of those three does not exist in measurable quantities in fossil carbon (carbon 14). It's reduction in more modern samples of CO2 shows that the preponderance of the change is fossil carbon, not terrestrial. We are completely responsible for the increase in global CO2. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Are you capable of critical thinking or even thinking your yourself? Obviously not.

The US GDP is only $20 Trillion, which is the same as their basic dept, but the US dollar is only backed up by oil. so if there's $80 Trillion in circulation , yet there's only about $2 Trillion worth of global oil sales per year, how can the $US be worth as much as its claimed to be? Its yet another example of the "Emperors new clothes" 🤣The Chinese Government has rated the US financially as about the same value as a poor African Nation, yet they claim to be the richest nation in the World🤣Not that China is much better now! They were fine just like Russia, until they both adopted capitalism as their main financial system. Capitalism is most succesful system ever created, apart from the fact the its caused both WW1 and WW2, and will probably cause WW3, and countless stock market crashes, and numerous losses of lively hood and masses of greed. Where Russia and China went wrong is that they NEVER implemented communism correctly! Had they done so, then the US would probably also have adopted a democratic form of communism , but they didn't which is why the World is now in such a terrible financial state! The World now needs the Messiah to return more than ever, but so far I've been unable to find a valid email address for God🤣, to facilitate the return of the Messiah🤣	UCPgSOusbdTZYFn55QCf9Jmw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPgSOusbdTZYFn55QCf9Jmw	1	UgyFAVqyPdG9rm8KTf54AaABAg	Professor Snowberg

Are you aware that the majority of those who deny the reality of AGW & ACC do so based on biblical literalism? There are two main camps, one that maintains it is their EndTimes and the other that puny homo sapiens can not affect their god's perfect creation. Are you also aware that Tim Ball, John Christy and Roy Spencer try to make science fit their faith?

I understand the resistance of those who are standing to lose income during the transition, but that doesn&#39;t justify the continuation of wasting precious resources, energy and labour when there is a better way. Electric cars need less parts, last longer and use energy more efficiently than their gasoline counterparts. Solar panels produce energy cheaper and can be installed quickly and everywhere with no need to transport electricity over hundreds of kilometers. Not to mention the widely ignored impact on the enironment.<br /><br /><br />As I said before: I understand the bad situation the producers of oil and car parts are in - but that does not give them the right to spread misinformation about the scientific fact of climate change and to slander politicians and citizens who want this transition to happen as soon as possible.<br /><br /><br />Is the world going to turn into an &quot;agenda 21&quot; police state if we drive electric instead of gasoline cars? Are we all going to die of hunger if robots and AI and the electrification of our traffic take half of our jobs? I don&#39;t think so. So even if all the climatologists were in on the climate conspiracy - what is there more to loose than the noise and the stink in our cities?

The man spoke for ten minutes without saying anything at all that would suggest man-made climate change, that global warming &#39;is a hoax&#39;. Christ, I had to take notes, watching the video very carefully. The rest of the shit that he says is either a stupid thing to say, or, highly suspect, because he&#39;s just using really poorly chosen, large words in quick succession to dazzle an audience of laypersons who, in most circumstances, would give to the speaker, the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t a speech about why global warming is a hoax. This is a speech about why this man believes that environmentalism is an attempt to dominate all the peoples of the world, under the guise of well-doing, but, in fact, it&#39;s mean, evil, servitude.<br /><br />Like... I can&#39;t believe someone sent me this video as an attempt to dissuade me of believing the current climate science.<br /><br />Monckton, you&#39;re a fool, and when you die, the world will be a little better for it.

This is why Jesus Christ promised He had to return a second time, and put an end to this evil. Genesis 1: 28 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

Overall , the increase in temperature is so negligible , Natural Variability far exceeds its influence,,, ( even Water Vapor is a bigger driver ). <br /> CO2 forcing a Global Warming is &quot;total nonsense&quot; &amp; most honest Scientists know it.

He also claims he was Special Science Advisor to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Seems Thatcher didn't know this, nor did anyone else in her team, but his lies impresses the gullible, don't they. Did you know The American Physical Society found 125 errors in a scientific paper he wrote on the topic of global warming? How about that.? Regardless, he isn;' even a scientist, is he. He read Classics and also has a diploma in journalism. No science credentials whatsoever. No ad hom there, just facts.

If reality was so obvious to everyone - then we'd all be arriving at the same conclusions. Clearly, we don't. You name it; politics, climate change, religion or any other issue - we all hold to different beliefs and value systems. We can argue these points forever in a day. Reality will always fall in alignment with what we choose to believe. Why? There is a saying attributed to the prominent writer 'Anais Nin' that reflects this idea: "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are". In other words, our preconceptions can dramatically alter the way we perceive the world.

I state what I believe to be true. 1. I do not subscribe to the theory of human-caused global warming. I believe it was a manufactured crisis to begin with. You control CO2 - you control energy. Control energy and you control virtually everything. Now that's one hell of a financial incentive right there for companies, multi national corporations etc. to get on board. Money goes where the attention flows - Wong! (no doubt you're now going to tell me about the evils of the fossil-fuel industries) 2. I am an atheist. I have a loathing for all religion - but would never wish to deprive people of their favorite toy. I believe that people should have the freedom of choice to believe whatever they may choose. By my 'gullibility' and 'ignorance' etc. - please get a grip. I'm far from the first person to suggest that climate change has become a new religion. It's got virtually all of the same hallmarks! Furthermore, I'm not on social media. I pay no attention to it. You've made an assumption right there (big own goal there Wong). I'm only really active on 'You tube', etc and platforms like 'Quora' (topic-based platforms) where people discuss ideas. As for the remark 'start thinking for yourself' - how original! What you really mean to say is don't pay attention to anybody else and agree with my worldview (because my knowledge and wisdom far surpasses that of any other) I understand where you're coming from - I just don't agree with you.

I should get paid for this. an example of 'appeal to authority' is when you claim that this dog food is recommended by vets etc, even if it isnt. Understand so far? for example according to your logic, it is incorrect to say that the moon is made of rocks and dust because this is quoting the research done by those in authority! If a person reads and understands the research of those expert in the field on climate change, then this is not a logical error. Also suggesting that another person ie you should go and read the said research is not a logical error either. You should make sure you know what you are talking about before you comment. not sure what you mean by bandwagon; the earth is a sphere according to the "bandwagon" then etc Oh dear, it gets worse....AD HOMINEM this when you make the other person look stupid perhaps by rephrasing their argument. well, I have rephrased your argument correctly based on scientists created climate change to make money involving scamming millions of other highly skilled professionals. This a false dichotomy for start, though the issue here is climate change. to recap. 1. the information and research is their to be read by all. 2. the climate is difficult to model as there are so many variables for a start. 3. there is physical evidence to be seen all over the world, which means that the change is well underway. 4. in the past, there was some understandable doubts/predictions over what was happening and why. 5. there is only one planet, the damage cannot be just undone, and the population has demonstrated that they are now unable to cope with events like a simple financial crisis which is so insignificant compared to what climate change could easily mean.

Your question presumably is that people that are paid to do a job, make up information to for monetary gain. I would also be looking at logical fallacies, as you appear not to have a grip on this either. So, having read nothing about this subject even from any credible report, you conclude that the thousands directly involved, and the millions indirectly involved in climate research are all liars, and have created this lie to keep their jobs and so make money.

When the science community finally got some control, the the population exploded, and and people stared to live like royalty for extended lifespans; you are not part of the community. "...You act as if employees doing research have no incentives to support a certain narrative i.e. your mainstream gullible one, and that there is no ostracism for questioning the status quo..." You have concluded that the thousand directly involved, and the millions of others ie lecturers, teachers, all related subject, their peers, and friends (from all around the globe and just for a start, are stupid or in on a scam because according to you they have news that you dont like ie they are telling governments to try and set targets in order to curtail your rights as a westerner to continue to consume and add to the giga tonnes of fossil fuels already used. so, according to you , who has read nothing about it, knows nobody who does, concludes that the aforementioned personnel, the worlds governments... who you depend on for medicine, aircraft, electronics, communication, food, transport, criminal justice, everything around you, etc etc etc are all gullible???!! you are just a weird person buddy. global temps are up, and rising right now incidentally. i would go find some other way to demonstrate your individuality other than burning off fossil fuels. the climate is difficult to predict, the modeling is new science, and the risks are so great as there is no way back. once the signs are visible, then like a supertanker, the momentum is so great., it is impossible to stop once a positive feed back loop is in place. i suspect you come a listen to this cretin to try and get some reassurance. if you have any children, though it is difficult to believe you are an adult), then you will have to explain to them what you have done deliberately over decades. climate change means that the climate is changing in an unpredictable leading to extreme weather, but with an bias towards a warmer overall climate. which part of this simple concept dont you understand?

I came to this video to see if they had good arguments, because I'm not betting my life on it either way although I incline towards you being wrong since your side has no proof from what I have seen; just claims and charts easy to concoct out of your collective ass. The reason you call it climate change is that global warming is inaccurate, and your side backpedaled on the terminology. The best argument against global warming is that if it were true, then no sane person would invest in Florida which will be flooded soon according to your side, in a few generations, which is what they said a few generations ago, right? :-)	UC-CiZqwKVuXNcy6lc-cpPrA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-CiZqwKVuXNcy6lc-cpPrA	1	UgzJ_vY1zyn4jyekO4l4AaABAg	Adrian Bonnington

The government incidentally is 'polluted' by the influence of the fossil fuel industry otherwise society would be all electric by now. it is of course vital to question the government, which is common sense, and nothing to do with flat earth loons.

Regardless of what &quot;scientists&quot; say: if the sea level rises then it will rise everywhere, because the oceans are connected. So if it has not risen where you live it has not risen anywhere else, including on Mauritius. And I checked this with my local harbor office, whose statistics showed that there had been no sea level rise since measurements begun in the 1890s. It is exactly the same now as it was then. Some years it is higher of course, mostly because of autumn floods and spring tides. But of course this high point was in 1988, with a couple of close contenders in the 1930s.

I&#39;m not quite sure what it is that global warming deniers think they are going to get as a result of their beliefs. If they are wrong the human race will become extinct. If the believers in global warming are wrong then all we have had to do personally is save ourselves money by having smaller cars, better insulated houses, energy saving lighting, recycle our waste and a long list of things that benefit us anyway. How could all those scientists be involved in a conspiracy of such a scale? Clearly they couldn&#39;t, the key question is always qui bono or follow the money as americans would have it. Check out where Moncktons money is invested and you will find the answer.	UCGlJUUyRlg81HMwBMLOK_LQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGlJUUyRlg81HMwBMLOK_LQ	0

Between the medieval period and today, earth&#39;s temperature has &#39;world-endingly&#39; risen by 1.4 degrees celsius! And never forget(lol) it&#39;s only because of human economic activities. 50 million years ago, the earth&#39;s average temperature was 17 degrees celsius warmer. Caused by..you&#39;ve guessed it, humans! Quite simply, for the majority of the led by the nose and hoodwinked citizens, this is a massive politically and geopolitically motivated scam created to save the planet from its cancerous and destructive occupants, you and me. In order to achieve control, a dumbass bullcrap scapegoat was chosen, a 0.04% atmospheric and life-giving gas, co2. The origin of this co2 false hypothesis goes back 190 years to a scientist named Arrenhius. His guesswork was of course never tested and proved! Today, we know what he hypothesised was a hot air fart. But, it&#39;s a convenient truth, just like Shell Oil Company&#39;s Marion &#39;King&#39; Hubbert and his absurd peak oil theory. As you all are well aware, oil originates from, amongst other things, dead dinosaurs😆😆. Another massive media ans schoolbook-vehicled scam. The list is long, very long. Lastly, over here in France, guess how much money was given by Macron&#39;s government to the headbangers and jerks in the ecology party? 9 BILLION EUROS to fulfill their nutjob &#39;Transition Écologique!&#39; We the people will be taxed in order to achieve this objective. Telling lies pays, ask the ex-bartender and useful idiot actress, Alexandra shit for brains Cortez over in the US of A! She shows you how it&#39;s done! Yet another soulless pied piper.

This will give you the best chance for understand. If you still can’t get it don’t feel bad, sadly, many do not have the capacity to comprehend this topic.

OI tend to "collect" words and phrases I like and numpties is such a beautifully descriptive word. Probably Glaswegian as Lothians are far, far too refined! I also sailed and worked with quite a few Scots over the years. Ever heard of the Glasgow Greeks? That was the name we used for Denholm Ship Management (now part of Anglo-Eastern) when it started up. I read for my 2nd. degree with several young Officer Cadets from Denholms, including a female, one of the first. There are lots of numpties on AGW & ACC channels.

There is no study anywhere in the internet that supports your idea that we can't see the lower decks of a cruising ship near the horizon because of "refraction". When I asked you to explain it, you refused to do so. As you have also refused to even make a comment on any of my other questions. So yes, your refraction argument still stands - it stands unconfirmed by any evidence in the room. >> You saying it's wrong is not proof of anything. By claiming that the earth was not a globe you are making an extraordinary claim. Therefore the burden of proof is on you. If I ask you to provide evidence for your claim and you continue to refuse to give it, then I must assume that you are perfectly content to believe what you are being told in flat earth movies on blind faith alone and that evidence means nothing to you. >> Reality does not conform to your world view. If you believe so, then why not start by providing me with a flat earth world map showing the correct distance between Perth and Sydney (4,000km instead of 7,000km) - or by explaining how the sun can shine for more than six hours on two opposite sides of the flat earth disk without illuminating the North Pole in the center - or by giving me a reason for why no flat earther seems to have ever tried to buy a ticket for a cruise to Antarctica to try and disprove the midnight sun? If you are not ready to support your idea of a flat earth with anything more than the word "refraction", then why should anyone believe that your claim had any merit?

Look into "refraction." The disappearance of a ship's lower decks cannot be explained by refraction. What should bend the light in such a way that ships look half sunk in the water when they are close to the horizon? >> As for your other points, anyone doing a cursory study on the topic can quickly find the answers which debunk your "proofs." My other points were: 1.) There is no flat earth map showing the correct distances between the major cities of this world because it is impossible to draw such a map. 2.) There is a midnight sun in the Antarctic, which goes completely against the flat earth idea. 3.) On December 21st the sun shines for more than 6 hours at the same time on Buenos Aires and Sydney. They are on the opposite sides of the flat earth map. And on that day the sun does not even rise on the North Pole, which is right between these two cities. >> You don't look into the topic and instead throw the same points at us which we have proven to be wrong. So far you have not proven anything to me. 1.) I did some research in the internet and I could not find even one flat earth map that even attempts to show the correct distance between Perth and Sydney, which is roughly 4,000km and not 7,000km. I know how far it is because I drove it myself. Doesn't it strike you as odd that there is no "corrected" world map on any flat earth websites? 2.) I also know that the daylight hours on December 21 get longer and longer the farther South you go. Therefore I see no reason for why I should assume that on the last 3,500km from Hobart down to Antarctica the length of the day should stay the same or even shorten. If you had done so much research yourself: How come that you didn't notice that there is no thought wasted on any flat earth website about what happens to the daylight south of Tasmania during the winter solscite. There is nothing except the claim that there was no midnight sun in Antarctica. And what's even more fishy is that no flat earther ever seems to have bothered to try and buy a ticket to one of the cruises to Antarctica where the midnight sun is advertised as a highlight of the trip. 3.) The same goes for point three. You will not be able to find an explanation of the fact that the sun shines on Buenos Aires and Sydney at the same time. And that on a day when the North Pole which is supposed to be right between these two cities doesn't get any sunlight. >> Just the fact that you don't know what refraction even is proves you haven't even looked into any of this... You just assume that I don't know anything about refraction without even considering the possibility that I reject refraction as a possible explanation for hiding the lower decks of a cruise ship near the horizon. What would cause the light to bend upwards at any time of the day, under any atmospheric conditions. Even in the night a laser beam shot over a distance of one kilometer gets bent upward by several centimeters? By what? Flat Earth websites have no answer to that. So why shouldn't I assume that you never bothered to compare what's claimed on flat earth websites with what's written on those that debunk them?

Morales Sanchez	@Donald Duck  Your two points on boats, the horizon and sunsets prove how ignorant you are on the topic. Harsh word, but accurate. Look into "refraction." I explained it on an earlier post. Did you not read them before jumping in? As for your other points, anyone doing a cursory study on the topic can quickly find the answers which debunk your "proofs." People like you are the reason I don't bother to discuss this stuff in detail anymore. You don't look into the topic and instead throw the same points at us which we have proven to be wrong. If you don't want to bother looking into this yourself, then stay ignorant because I won't waste my time on people that don't bother to do simple research. I used to be like you. I believed Earth was a globe. I looked at the evidence. Now, I believe otherwise. And that number keeps on growing so calling us all 'stupid' doesn't fly anymore. Nobody converted me. I looked at the evidence myself. Did the research, myself. Just the fact that you don't know what refraction even is proves you haven't even looked into any of this so don't even try to tell me you have because you'd be lying. And no, I don't believe in fossil fuel so don't assume what I do and do not believe. Oil is a renewable resource like every other on earth. Like gold, which can be artificially created.

One explanation I can give you right away: >> Please explain how propulsion works in space We were taught this one in second grade. Why does a boat start moving in the opposit way if you make a dive from it into the water? Newton's third law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. By jumping into the water you are pushing the boat away from you losing part of your forward momentum. A rocket pushes gases (or liquid) from itself in one direction, and this pushes the rocket in the opposite direction. It is as simple as that. >> as it stands not even graduated engineers can explain it and they admit it. Really? What's the bet you read that on a flat earth website and nowhere else?

It may not be flat but it's not what they tell us either. Here is some proof that the earth is not flat: 1.) On a flat earth there can't be a midnight sun in the Antarctic. But there is one. 2.) It's impossible to draw a correct world map on a disk. In the southern hemisphere the distances are all off by far. 3.) The lower decks of a cruise ship at the horizon are not visible because they are beneath the horizon. 4.) You would never see the sun set on a flat earth There may very well be a world domination agenda. But I am not going to assume that renewable energy is part of it just because hefted commercial interest groups that are against it say so.

Don't go along with their name-changing. They employ it so as to bury the truth. I think you bought the fossil fuel narrative with hook and sinker. You can believe the propaganda of fossil fuel "think" tanks or the scientific consensus of all climatologists on earth. The average temperature of the earth's surface is rising.

Sextant corrections, long distance navigation, spherical trig, the fact that land slowly goes below the horizon when you sail away from it and slowly rises from the horizon when you sail towards it, the fact that you can see further with increasing height, celestial navigation and so on.

Morales Sanchez	@wong My own copypaste: "Please explain how a Lunar eclipse is possible when the sun is still visible in the sky. Please explain how in space the "planets" maintain an orbit and how the Sun rockets through space like a nozzle. In the Flat Earth model Quantum Locking explains the rotation of the Sun and Moon and how the seasons work perfectly. The Quantum Locking theory is supported by the Scientific Method because it can be replicated and observed under controlled conditions in a simple lab demonstration. The "planets" staying in their axis in the infinitum of space cannot be explained through the Scientific Method. Please explain how Polaris never moves and the same stars we have today are the ones that existed thousands of years ago which is why we can take ancient star charts and apply them to the current night sky. This Should not be possible if the Earth has been in constant movement alongside the Sun and other "planets" for millions and millions of years. Please explain why NASA openly admits to using Chaldean star charts that are thousands of years old to predict eclipses instead of knowing through satellites and imagery when the next one will be. Please explain cool moonlight. Please explain the visibility of objects like Chicago across Lake Michigan when such things should be miles below the curvature. Please explain the internet working via underwater cables (fact, look it up in wikipedia of all places) when many share the misconception that it functions by satellites. Please explain the need by NASA to launch balloons with communication equipment wasting millions in tax payer's money if we have stationary satellites that could do the job (satellies first came up in a science fiction book btw). Please explain why Google Earth images are taken by a military grade drone instead of satellites. Please explain why Google Earth uses the Flat Earth. Please explain the obviousness of NASA faked footage (the disappearing astronaut is especially amusing to watch). Please explain how propulsion works in space because as it stands not even graduated engineers can explain it and they admit it. Please explain Sun hotspots visible at ground level. Please explain the "lunar wave." Please explain the fact that flights in the lower "hemisphere" between the continents are straight lines when their courses are applied to the Flat Earth model as opposed to zig-zags in the heliocentric model. What is the shortest route between two points? A straight line. Please explain gravity. Seriously, explain gravity, because as it stands it makes no sense whatsoever. The Earth's oceans are held in place by gravity but a weightless butterfly can flutter effortlessly off the ground? Please explain how the supposedly disappearing vessels over the ocean's horizon appear again in view with a strong enough zooming device like cameras or binoculars. Please explain the horizon always being at eye level no matter at which height you are. Please explain NASA being started by NAZIS via Operation Paperclip. Said NAZIS were obssesed with occult practices and were masters of propaganda because of over a century of pyschological mastery started with the first experimental laboratory of psychology which was founded in Germany in the mid 1800s. But what do I know, I'm just a close minded, bible thumping, backwards thinking conspiracy theorist. That's what I'm called anyway when the opposing party dismisses my claims without looking into them because they prefer to stay in the cult of science camp. They cannot even humor the thought of having been lied to. As CIA Director William Casey once said; "We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false." The CIA was also founded by Operation Paperclip Nazis. It was called the OSS but that all changed once the Third Reich moved house. Where are the other big space agencies located? Russia, an ex-communist nation. That's not too reassuring. China, a still communist nation. Even less reassuring. The best astronomers out there? Well forget that, what organization birthed modern astronomy? The Catholic Church believe it or not. They still produce the "best" astronomers out there and have access to top-of-the-line observatories like the one they called "Lucifer." What. The. Hell. Yeah I'll believe the Jesuit run kingdom of Rome that killed over 100,000,000 people on the basis that they possessed knowledge that took power away from them and forced women to have sex with preachers or else they would call them out as witches. Nice history they try to hide there and ironic that they made the heliocentric model what it is today when Copernicus showed them the model considering how much it feeds into the anti-biblical and anti-theist evolutionary theories. Your move dear reader and please resist the urge to insult my intelligence and call me mean hurtful names that accomplish nothing but demonstrate the lack of maturity, restraint and knowledge modern society seems to possess."

People died in their millions from disease and two world wars. So now ever on the search for something to loath ourselves with we come up with climate change. As if the climate never changes.

There is profound data, that the global average temperature is increasing and that the typical climate pattern changes since the begin of the industrialization and out of that the begin of burning fossil energy carriers. There is also data on the air concentration back to over 400.000 years, what scientists found through so called ice-core-drilling. The mixes of gases are stored in the depths of the ice. And this data shows that the CO2 level has never been over 300 ppm (parts per million) for 400.000 years and all of the sudden it is nearly at 400 ppm nowadays and inclines strongly. So please don&#39;t spread your uninformed opinion on a scientific proofed topic just because it makes your life easier. Fact is that it is happening, but the consequences are highly unclear and that&#39;s one of many reason why the world is not on &quot;red alert&quot;. Why should you as an individual change, when there is no reward for it?!	UCaQ1UF49DPLA4cexhj2-tIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaQ1UF49DPLA4cexhj2-tIw	0

In 1975, Time Magazine had &#39;Beware of the Coming Ice Age&#39; on their cover and Walter Cronkite had the same lead in on more than 1 occasion in the same year. Then, it morphed into Global Warming (when &#39;The New Ice Age&#39; fizzled. All of the new predictions proved false. And yet the computer modelled prediction continued unabated. All of the decade + predictions have not turned out to be true. True scientists never say &quot;The science is settled&quot; because they are always re-evaluating what it believed to be true. They seek the truth, not consensus.	UCAI8OBt1xUEm7fjKLUyZDcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAI8OBt1xUEm7fjKLUyZDcA	0

The hoax is the claim there is a scientific debate; there is none. The hoax, perpetrated by the Koch brothers, Exxon, and others who shift trillions in costs onto the public, is that global warming is not real or is the result of natural causes. There is no logical reason for the earth to be warming at this unprecendented rate other than human activity, the burning of fossil fuels and the release of methane. You can accept industry propagnda or the research of scientists: your choice.	UCsc7jWX2cHg2K027JmxgwPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsc7jWX2cHg2K027JmxgwPA	0

(talking about perspective) i also hate when governments use global warming as an excuse to tax people if those taxes don't go directly to renewables. but the trillion$ petrol industry also pays researchers, and there are also neutral scientists out there (but who don't have research money) if petrol didn't manage to bulge the neutral ones, but governments did, doesn't that tell us who is right ?

It's impossible for such a minute amount of a green house gas to hold so much heat. More clouds does mean more rain as a warmer atmosphere would just make the clouds form higher in the sky. There's only 2 explinations for global warming and ice ages, it's either the sun or our orbit around the sun. Our orbit around the sun is not perfect and a slight fluctuation in our orbit can have have a huge effect on our climate. The sun's energy output can also affect atmospheric temperature. Changes in the tilt of the earths axis can cause ice ages in one hemisphere and warming in the other hemisphere. Co2 and other green house gases increased with the warming , not causing it. It's these reasons that can only explain all our historical/current warming and cooling events, but you'd rather believe that it's the minute rise in co2 causing it. These scientists say global warming is man made because they're getting payed by the government to prove it is man made and their jobs depend on it. The government needs it to be a human cause so they can tax us with carbon tax.

Bodies also radiate light (usually infrared), witch cools them down (infrared and thermal cameras work by measuring that). greenhouse gases are the ones that reflect infrared (reflecting earth's radiation back into itself ) gases without an greenhouse effect are transparent to infrared . i do not need you to put things into perspective for me. i have all the perspective i need. but if for a body the incoming radiation is equal to the outgoing one, he won't change it's temperature. it's easy to see why a decrease of the outgoing radiation (no matter how small) will inevitably result in ever increasing temperature. greenhouse is not affected by a substance's ability to hold heat. it's affected by it's ability to reflect radiation . this is why it makes perfect sense that not all gases are greenhouse gases. water vapor IS the main greenhouse gas, and that's what makes it dangerous. because it's hardest to control. even a slight increase in co2 , witch only increased temperature a little bit, would result in a bit more evaporated water, which would result in even higher temperatures and so on. this snowball effect is why many people think it may be already too late. global warming is not an increase in gas density. but in it's ability to reflect radiation. now let's talk about why global warming is bad. sure, live thrived in all sorts of environments, but not human life. we spent our entire existence adapting to our current environment , and changing it would definitely hurt us, in a way we are not adapted to deal with. every time there was a mass extinction event, it was the life who was most adapted to the old environment who died first, and whatever was left thrived. btw. in a warmer world, more clouds =/= more rain. because vapor needs to COOL down to precipitate. there would just be more clouds floating around, doing nothing but reflecting our radiation back at us, making us warmer, making more clouds.

Co2 in our atmosphere is 400 parts per MILLION!, to put that into perspective , imagine a swimming pool and diluting it with a cup of coffee. The particles of co2 are so minute and spread out that it is practically impossible for them to hold heat more than any other gas like nitrogen, it makes no sense. Like I said all gasses are green house gasses , even water vapour which is the main green house gas. The cause of global warming is increased gas density, an increase of any gas will cause a green house effect. There was a time when there was no ice on the poles and the sea temperature at the poles was a comfy 23 degrees Celsius or so, jungles covered the earth and life THRIVED! the cold actually creates desserts as it reduces the amount of water vapour in the air trapping it in ice. Warmer world = more water vapour = more clouds = more rain = more vegetation = more oxygen.

Nitrogen, oxygen and argon together make up close to 100 percent of the atmosphere. But all three are invisible to incoming "short-wave" radiation from the sun and outgoing "long-wave" radiation from the Earth's surface. They play no role in regulating the planet's atmospheric temperature.	UCdntSXzHFKxssfNJ3zdfjUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdntSXzHFKxssfNJ3zdfjUg	1	UgyrDT8laCs8UWcCpYN4AaABAg	Mark Pearson

I think it important to at least listen to the other side of the debate and have listened to other climate change deniers. I have listened enough to come to the conclusion that some are just fucked in the head just like those who truly believe that Jesus is on his way and there is no need for man to save the earth. There are others that are just charlatans like Mr. Grabembythepussie that spews bullshit as long as it results in money flowing into their pockets one way or another. Kinda want to be exposed more to the idiots just to fathom and explore that world of theirs as it is kinda fascinating. As for the charlatans, they are traitors to mankind and the earth itself. I hope all these fools buy all the land they can within 2 metres hight from high tide as this land will be worthless in 20 years as it will be obvious that there will be less than another 20 years before the ocean makes these properties uninhabitable without very expensive retaining walls. The acidification of reducing all life in the ocean along with exponential rise in ocean levels and climate change will be in large part the fault of these complete asshole traitors and should be held accountable in the years to come. Go completely Stalin on these fuckers.	UCIwv7g-1NpVx_lC066g2zQA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIwv7g-1NpVx_lC066g2zQA	0

This type of heat transfer is called convection. that's whats going on in Australia now with unprecedented 120 + degree days in the south and unprecedented flooding in the north and the american continent freezing over...warm air movement brings more evaporation, more rain and snow more heat from the equator going south. Greater disturbance from in the air layers bringing freezing air from high up above the jet stream to ground level. EVERY YEAR IS THE HOTTEST ON RECORD NOW!! Extreme wind speeds have increased over most of the globe by approximately 10 per cent over the last 20 years GLOBAL WARMING CAUSES EXTREMES IN TEMPERATURE.......simply because the wind increases...

But nope....they just continue pressing it. That&#39;s called stupidity. If you believe man-made climate change is a huge problem, you are willfully stupid. Simple as that. We have real-world proof that climate scientists in the late 1990&#39;s and early 2000&#39;s were proven FALSE through empirical evidence and observations of the last 20 years. They have no further excuse for pushing their stupidity on the general public.	UCx9u9FT8YGOAknqZRFx2B1A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx9u9FT8YGOAknqZRFx2B1A	0

I remember a sociologist in college asking the class what we thought the sons and daughters of the elite study in college. Engineering, physics, finance, accounting, mathematics, political science? The professor said all wrong. History, because if one is going to inherit and rule the world, one must know its history. Monckton has an extremely high IQ, and is obviously well read in many areas, and surely could be an academic in many fields if he chose. I would not discount his ability to analyze information and draw sound, well reasoned, logical conclusions because he doesn't have a particular degree or qualification as you have suggested. Look at his work on the Eternity puzzle and you will see that his interests and abilities go beyond journalism and politics.

Oil companies evn admit that the science is correct, at least as much as the "theories" of electromagnetism and electron shells, etc, are correct (because that's what it's based on). If you do not believe that the Earth is a sphere, or that stars are not made out of what the scientist say, then, by all means, continue denying the _same science_ that doesn't suit your fancy. It's your choice. But when people like you make policy... no, not acceptable. Kinda like allowing someone with NO science background make policy changes in a Star Trek environment (because we're quite techy ourselves already)... Only a few scientists mentioned soot, back when soot was more of a concern than it is now. Media played it and deniers lived the role, so to speak. Now, fossil fuels are cleaner (but still emit CO2) thanks to pollution laws (which idiot country dividing fuckhead wants to delete, bty).

However, there was another Al (Alvin Weinberg) that predicted a warmer world based upon the chemistry of GHGs. He also predicted that we'd have about 400 ppm CO2 somewhere around the year 2000. He predicted this in the 60's when there was only 320 ppm instead of the 420 we have now. He co-invented today's nuclear and invented the molten salt reactor that got shut down after proven successful, the MSRE at ORNL. However, he _also_ founded the SERI, now the NREL (he was a smart man). Not only did he think it was possible to power humanity with safe meltdown proof nuclear, he thought it _might_ be possible to make such a thing called a solar panel. Granted, Bell labs had got the idea out, first, but _nobody_ could imagine in their wildest dreams that we would have solar for about $1/watt... And in their wildest nightmares that the future people would be reluctant to use them as they begun their entrance into *BIOFRY...*	UC58rRIsThYpH4Oxc92wGKng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC58rRIsThYpH4Oxc92wGKng	1	UgwAUAXX6SRlJOep2yF4AaABAg	fireofenergy

We&#39;re chopping down-and burning-all of the forests, especially rain forests. We are dumping our garbage everywhere and the oceans are changing, acidifying and becoming devoid of life. We are changing some of our habits which is good but developing nations are not. They are the worst perpetrators but we&#39;re all guilty and if we don&#39;t stop everything will change, probably for the worse. International laws should be placed to stop polluting and destruction. Any nation that violates the laws being subject to sanctions, embargo or invasion. Nature is fragile and so are we and when you swing a pendulum, it swings back. Climate change or not something is going to happen if it isn&#39;t already. What a legacy we are leaving! Climate change may or may not be a reality but the damage we are doing is indisputable but instead of just dealing with it, we argue with each other. It&#39;s going to get rough if we continue to live this way. We might all be sick soon. Then it would be harder to fix things.

Ugz9hCBUirZZq5wpOvJ4AaABAg	1	0	2019-01-20 04:42:50	Eric Lee	This talk is in two halves, in the wrong order. He presents his data after 15 minutes of journalistic, would-be coercive language and is no less than filled with conspiracy theory than he accuses the IPCC of promoting. His most relevant chart of temperature, conspicuously fails to show a temperature scale, or its meaningful equivalent. What he manifestly fails to do is to consider the possibility that the models have a grain of truth to them and if so, what are the necessary minimal steps humans need to do to set bounds on the size of the problem instead of ignoring it. Given the risks, he fails to consider what would be the minimum action necessary with the data that we have. Above all, his whole approach seems to be based on the “common sense” notion that the planet surface temperature, based upon historical records over 4.5 billion years and 1500 volcanoes, cannot possibly be exhibiting the reported trends over the last century. Humans have previously fallen foul of reasoning based upon common sense. (Such a notion is akin to that of the speed of light must depend upon the speed of the observer). His argument is a huge extrapolation of the notion that one cannot possibly be affecting the climate to start a camp fire to cook one’s dinner. Not considered is massive steel production which necessarily uses coking coal influencing temperatures in the vanishingly thin habitable zone of this, our only planet. Volcano eruptions are intermittent while steel production, 1 billion cars and 100K commercial flights and 50K merchant ships spewing each day are continuous. Volcanoes exist across the earth’s surface, but the maps show emissions are predominantly happening in the northern hemisphere where, coincidentally, the carbon dioxide is mostly emitted. This tirade lacks sufficient consideration of the fragility of the earth’s climate, given that we are not in a position to do the science prospectively; we are reliant upon retrospective data and therefore must consider what “margins for error” need to be built into corrective action - even if they were not totally secure and financially costly.

Al Gore qualche anno fa parlò di rischio di aumento di 6 metri nel 2100 (che vorrebbe dire lo scioglimento dell&#39;intera superficie della Groenlandia), oltre che dello scioglimento dei ghiacci estivi dell&#39;Artico nel 2016. <br /> Attenzione, il dato ipotizzato dalla Nasa, 3,2 mm/anno, comporterebbe, nel calcolo citato sopra, un ritiro delle coste veneziane di sei metri all&#39;anno. <br />Fenomeno mai osservato. <br />Da quando sono nato dovrebbero essersi ritirate di 360 metri, un terzo di kilometro, nientemeno.

A lot of perfectly nice people look at Greenpeace advertisements or whatever and go, “Aww, these cute little penguins are dying because of us. Humanity sucks.&quot; and all that. In the winter of 2017, 90% of one of the largest Adelie penguin flocks died. The reason? Surprisingly for some - not global warming! Those penguins didn&#39;t drown to death - they starved. The penguins died because there was TOO MUCH ice, not too little - they couldn&#39;t reach the ocean so they couldn&#39;t catch enough fish. I personally find it hard to believe that the Earth is getting hotter - the trend definitely seems to be very erratic, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily have a positive correlation. For example, I live in Shanghai, and for many years, there had been no snow. For the last two winters and springs, however, snowfall had been increasing, and temperatures, falling. By no means is this unrefutable proof that the Earth is getting hotter OR colder, obviously, the sample size is much too small - the point merely illustrates my personal experiences and thus my personal perspective.<br />So let&#39;s just entertain the notion - well, even if the Earth is getting hotter, it&#39;s not necessarily due to anthropogenic causes. It&#39;s very egotistical of us to think that we can make a noticeable difference to the GLOBAL temperature. Sure, we can fill up the ocean with plastic, we can turn the sky gray with sulphur dioxide pollution - but to think that HUMANS can actually contribute enough to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to make a legitimately noticeable difference in the magnitude of the GREENHOUSE EFFECT is absolutely absurd. Even if we were to build a HUNDRED million more factories, the carbon dioxide emitted will be barely an iota of the total CO2 emission - by things like decaying plant matter, dying animals, et cetera. Not to mention that carbon dioxide itself actually only makes up a fraction of the greenhouse gases - water vapour is the major part. So what does this mean? This means that we can&#39;t do jackshit about global warming and trying to fight it is only counterproductive and directly hurts people right now, as mentioned in the video.<br />This is a load of bullshit, and it&#39;s very sad that a lot of intelligent and independent thinkers are convinced by this crap. It&#39;s not just some harmless ideology. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.	UChv-WTRKKIWD8ozNIoH63Ng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChv-WTRKKIWD8ozNIoH63Ng	0

Scientific terminology is wrong because even if it’s correct, it’s too verbose.<br />2. (Using a verbose quote) True patriots do not question the present, they must without question revere the past actions of “hero’s” who defeated totalitarian governments.<br />3. The democratically-voted “Totalitarian” British governments want to prevent your access to heating.<br />4. Mao did #3. Britain is doing it now, just like Mao.<br />5. Public educators do not teach the scientific method; instead they support eugenics, unsupervised governance, and deny religious dogma.<br />6. Because politicians are hypocrites with their reaction to global warming, global warming should be mocked.<br />7. Climate consensus is the result of “one” man; all individual scientists accepting global warming are puppets.<br />8. I am one of few scientists to deny global warming, and you dismissed me.<br />9.Sea levels are not increasing ANYWHERE, wind turbines promote CO2, the ice caps are not melting.<br />10. I am right, all other scientists are wrong, governments that support scientist other than me are trying to ruin your life without reason.

An electrical engineer, who was born in one of the islands to the East of PNG, was frantic - the Global Warming Alarmists were telling him that within five years his beloved island would be under water. Oh, panic, panic. Now, twenty five years later, it has still not happened. He came from an island with no written history, so they had developed over the millenia a retentive memory. So he could remember all his teachings and become an engineer. But he had not learned how to question stuff. Just like most global warmists now. They are nothing more than USEFUL IDIOTS. Blindly following Al Gore and his cabal. An interesting book that you should all read is &quot;WATERMELONS&quot; written by James Delingpole. There are plenty more but you should really have an OPEN MIND. A scarce commodity among the alarmists.	UCAtaDdAPprXWA555d-liJgQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAtaDdAPprXWA555d-liJgQ	0

Always. It always has, going to long before man was in the picture. There is nothing new about this.<br /><br />TWO: <br /><br />That the UN scientist&#39;s + green crowd models have grossly over predicted global temperature increases vs the resultant actual changes ... <br /><br />They have been WRONG, dead wrong to the alarmist side .... EVERY time. <br /><br />Therefore any RATIONAL person is BY NOW is perfectly justified to be skeptical. It is only those that are:<br /><br />- politically motivated<br />- &quot;green religious dogma&quot; indoctrinated<br />- or morons ....<br /><br />who by this time would NOT be skeptical.<br /><br />The very fact that the MSM does nothing but constantly kill endless trees with miles of newsprint dedicated to &quot;green issue&quot; stories. Stories which seem ever more hysterical despite mounting evidence all the while that the climate is changing always, and the direction is not actually always up in recent times, nor past. All to the exclusion of MANY other relevant and REAL news stories. This is all one needs to see to know that it is largely a hoax.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the above bullets still describe 65% + of the population of Western Civilization. <br /><br />Luckily, it seems the smell of a sea change in the political and educational tides is coming ... I sense the first wafts of change in the winds.

Many of those subsidies and that corporate r&d are towards new tech to ... actually reduce pollution. The stuff we should b focusing on. But which ... oddly is rarely implemented in the 3rd world which is now responsible for most of the water pollution worldwide. None of which has anything to do with CO2 and climate change boondoggle we were discussing. The scam which is solely designed to take western taxpayer $ and send it to the 3rd world based corporstists via rhe UN to implement ... cheaper fossil fuel based power and factories staffed by cheaper labour. Stick 2 your labs mr. Researcher and stay ignorant to geo political nuances and realities driving the world. And you also never responded to the fact your "climate research" colleagues have missed the mark wildly to the high side for years in their predictions? Given the track record ... why should anyone believe a word u have to say at this point? Until someone publishes a credible study showing a rationale for why the slight temp increases of the past 40 years ISN'T a natural result of the most likely cause ... increased solar activity ... I'm not listening to a word of it any longer.	UC6uiC03C4RBUmXQ1y2owFpA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6uiC03C4RBUmXQ1y2owFpA	1	UgwKNJFYStYhnnvis0l4AaABAg	ch1nmuzak

It is by no means a 'government' based hoax, the evidence is clear as day, the impact we are having on the environment is already not sustainable which is only going to be exaggerated as population increases. The people that are doing this research, like me, are just normal people doing their jobs or getting their degrees, not brainwashed 'Big government' conspirators. Its actually costing governments and business billions to create green incentives, look up the circular economy, it would be much more finically beneficial to continue to dump toxic by-products, or not have to come up with clever systems to reuse waste emissions instead of just releasing them, or doing RnD into new more sustainable technologies, etc I could go on. This WOULD NOT be happening if it wasn't based entirely in fact, this is the only time ever industry has not been driven solely by monetary gain, morality has intercepted. I think people in this thread who claim to be the ones aware to the world are in fact the ones brainwashed, look at the correlation with public speakers and politicians that oppose climate chain and those with finical backing from the petroleum industry, look at John Mcain, he was staunchly in favour of climate change but when he received 5 million in campaign funds from shell and instantly he changed his opinion..... Oil/ gas and coal are the special interest parties convincing a subsection of people into believing this is a hoax, you are very wrong to be a sceptic.

And Al Gore just happened to be in business with the head of assett management at Goldman Sachs. And it just so happens that investment bankers spend large sums of money on climate scientists when investing their money in farm crops and fossil fuels and other weather dependent commodities.

Left-wing ideas are based on pie-in-the-sky moral cravings and they are put into practice using the fruits of free markets and moral-based societies (resulting in the destruction of those free markets and moral-based societies.) Look at how unsustainable and fractured Western civilization has become since becoming "liberal" and "progressive" sixty years ago. We went from being the most technologically advanced, materially rich and socially sophisticated society in human history to being a society defined by debt, ignorance, disrespect, drug addiction, broken families, insufficient birthrates and nihilism.

Nuclear power is actually safer than coal, natural gas, and most renewable energy sources, and its power output dwarfs any other energy source. Not to mention it could lead to more funding for nuclear fusion research, which could eventually lead to the first fusion reactor and provide nearly unlimited clean energy for the entire planet.

Public uncertainty is all that's required to achieve their ONLY goal - stall/minimize/prevent any profit-harming regulations on business. 1. When it comes to science, believe the scientists. Here's what they say: https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/ 2. Although the scientific details are incredibly complex, I think the shortest easiest thing to clarify the situation is perhaps the following link (animation). If you watched 21 minutes of Monckton's drivel, then invest 30 seconds and look at this: www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/ 3. If you care to read in detail about the science (there's no need - by #1 you already know what they've found, and by #2 you can pretty quickly see why), then you could read the IPCC reports, which are summaries of the science on the issue (Working Group 1 is about the science - there are 2 other working groups). They're massive and detailed reports, but have a relatively brief and less technically demanding "Summary for Policy Makers" that you should maybe read first. www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/	UC1P6Ae215-rQbCADlBFBBeg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1P6Ae215-rQbCADlBFBBeg	1	UgxfUdk-mAcsV3osZ7d4AaABAg	Basket Weaver

If that is the case, then we need to go &#39;100% renewable&#39; in a relatively short time, say 10 years, to avoid disaster. However, we&#39;ve been installing renewables for over 20 years and all we have to show for it is 2% of the world&#39;s energy, or about 8% of electricity. <br /><br />Even if we take the most optimistic estimates and assume that by Herculean efforts we could increase the installation rate by a factor of ten over that of the last decade, that would still mean 50 years, or until 2070, to go 100% renewable. By all accounts that will be no use, climate catastrophe will have struck long before then. <br /><br />Here I&#39;m only allowing for the building of wind turbines, etc. There will be additional work and costs for energy storage systems, etc. So the real picture will be worse than this. <br /><br />The global spend on renewables is currently $350 billion a year, mostly on wind turbines and solar panels. That is more than the total cost of the Apollo program ($270 billion in modern money) which gave us six lunar landings and three orbital missions. If we upped that by a factor of ten for the next 50 years, we would be committing the world to spending the equivalent cost of sending 1,500 astronauts to the Moon and back. I think this maybe puts the cost in perspective better than just quoting a huge impersonal number. It is a simply insane cost. And, it will be all for nothing because it will be too late anyway. <br /><br />So, not only is the proposed solution not going to work, but it will be such a huge drain on the global economy, that it will cause all kinds of other problems for humanity. <br /><br />But, it will of course line the pockets of the renewables investors.

If a trusted financial website had stats showing that your insurer was the most expensive around but had only paid 1% of claims, would you continue with that policy, or look for a better option? If you then found that the insurer in question was being subsidized from the public purse, and had put out all kinds of baloney advertising claims in order to gain that public support? If you then read the small print and found that you were not covered on certain random days of the year, and would have to pay for a second even more expensive policy (which had not even been drafted yet and maybe would never be available) to cover the missing days?

If that is the case, then..._ Although you're mistaken in assuming that "disaster" is an all-or-nothing affair rather than a matter of degree (and timing), your general approach is absolutely right. Rationally, we must consider the costs-versus-benefits for all the possibilities before us, and for all decisions we might make. However, a proper accounting of both costs and benefits is a very complicated matter. The main thing that you're totally overlooking is the harms & costs we'll incur from NOT acting. So what you're doing is akin to complaining that buying insurance is expensive, or paying for college is expensive, or that amputating a gangrenous limb is harming a person. Sure, such things are expensive/harmful... but to rationally evaluate that cost you must consider the consequences if you don't do them.

The trees, and the plants that we eat etc. need the CO2 that we breathe out, so that they can take the CARBON and give back the OXYGEN = CO2. We understand that the Climate Hierarchy are paranoid about PEOPLE, and dedicated to depopulation, and they must know that without sufficient CO2 there can be no life on earth, as when there is an Ice Age. So they convince people to turn against themselves and try to stop the CARBON that makes life possible. This is a kind of SUICIDE BY GULLIBILITY! Fossil Fuels were provided by God and I love God and I love fossil fuels. I hate the murderous Windmills. I just wish somehow these deluded 19th Century Malthusians could see that their fears are unfounded and rather turn to doing something productive and loving.

Let alone that portion of climate change that may or may not be due to man? If you really gave a rip about endangered species you might advocate for some small portion of the $ and energy being spent on the CO2 \ global warming boondoogle to be redirected to: - POLLUTION reduction - protection of habitat. Where that $ would actually have a positive effect. THOSE are the main reasons for flora and fauna loss. But .. that will never happen because there is no PROFIT in that path for the globalists. BTW ... if the earth is warming or cooling NATURALLY ( which seems reasonably likely considering it ALWAYS has). AND its doing so to an extent that its actually killing off some species ... THAT would just be a repeat of the evolutionary cycle that has played itself out many times before and MOST importantly ... that would almost certainly be solar activity based with nothing we are able to do about it. Adapt or perish is the message of nature to all species in that case ! The proper response by us should be not to spend our $ and resources futilely trying to reverse the direction but rather ... spending it on developing ways to adapt.

And the Arctic is melting away. Quickly. When we get the blue ocean events hitting the Arctic, the rate of heating increase up there will dramatically increase. You use "ice field" and "ice cap" and I'm not sure you know what you are talking about. Let's use the preferred "ice sheets" for land ice and "sea ice". When the captive methane in the Arctic vents in earnest, the temperature could rise globally by an average of 5C. in as little as 13 years. With the end of dimming as industry shuts down, we get another 0.6C minimum. Methane concentrations were about 700ppb for decades and probably longer.

"They haven't even been able to credibly assign the extent to which CO2 emission increases are attributable to man." Wrong. they know that virtually all of the increased CO2 is due to human activity, mostly burning, or venting, fossil fuels in the atmosphere. We know how much fossil fuel is extracted, since it's a commodity and is shipped, paid for, quantified pretty well. We know how much CO2 burning that much carbon would produce. We know the volume of the atmosphere. We then calculate the rise in concentration based on those numbers. We measure CO2 directly to confirm the calculation. (see Keeling Curve). We also measure the isotopic ratios of C12 vs C13. Very old carbon has almost no C13, it's all C12. The rise of C12 represents almost all of the expected rise in CO2, ergo nearly all of the rise in CO2 is due to human activity, mostly burning fossil fuels. So, once again, you were WRONG. @ch1nmuzak	UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	1	UgxF1i_kqFtoZsr6Unx4AaABAg	kim weaver

"In order to discern who governs over you, determine whom you are not permitted to criticize.". Basically , the green revolution has become a religion, it is now blasphemy to point out obvious holes in the "science" they are espousing. 2. "Follow the money.". In other words, at this point, who actually pays for, funds, and pushes the green agenda THESE days ? HINT: Its no longer mom and pop west coast sending Green Peace $10 a month in the mail ... its HUGE $ interests. Ones that, on the face of it, don;t seem to have a stake in the game. Which makes one wonder ... exactly what game is it that's being played ? Suggestion: perhaps one that is more about global politics and western government \ society destabilization than about the environment ? Forces who saw the fledgling green movement as a means to an end ? If you look at who is funding green activist orgs ... its hard to escape this conclusion. Actually, I read the graphs and pics correctly from beginning 2017 -> present, the NET ice melt when adding both the arctic and antarctic together was pretty much = 0. It is a fact that acrtic ocean water temperatures, for the first time in years, actually dropped slightly in one or both of 2017 + 2018. My point being that these fluctuations in Air temp, ocean water temp, water levels, and ice ... may be ( likely) largely natural. None of the doomsday green modelers predictions on the "international panel" side have been anywhere near their target since day 1 ( now 30 years and running) . That's a FACT. Given their record, they should all have been discredited and fired by the UN years ago. I would have been in my job with results like that but no, they remain gainfully emplyed and quoted ... because they pump out the message those in power want the public to hear. NO ONE has been able to CREDIBLY quantify to what extent the slight upwards trends in temp of the past 40 years are attributable to man. If at all. They just measure the overall slight increase and then write freak out papers and news stories. THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTIVE Q TO ANSWER! EARTH"S CLIMATE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHANGING. IN both directions. That by itself is NOTHING new. To be meaningful, man's contribution to any result has to be reasonably accurately separated. They haven't even been able to credibly assign the extent to which CO2 emission increases are attributable to man. A MUCH easier task on the whole. What modestly credible studies that have been done peg the CO2 level increase % attributable to man as MINIMAL, so minimal that complete elimination of our contribution to the total amount of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere would be of little effect, positive or negative. AND, even if man is responsible for a significant enough amount of both Co2 emission increases and temp rises that changes in our behavior would make a difference ... they definitely haven't been able prove \ say \ or even cogently theorize whether these rises are even bad for the earth and JUST AS IMPORTANTLY MAN in the long run. It is all a "project fear" scam IMO, which is not unfounded nor unresearched.	UC6uiC03C4RBUmXQ1y2owFpA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6uiC03C4RBUmXQ1y2owFpA	1	UgxF1i_kqFtoZsr6Unx4AaABAg	kim weaver

Arctic vs. Antarctic Because the Arctic and Antarctic are cold, dark, and remote, we often think these two places are nearly the same. However, they are quite different. One notable difference is that polar bears live only in the Arctic, and penguins live only in the Antarctic. But what about the differences in sea ice between the two regions? Geography Sea ice differs between the Arctic and Antarctic, primarily because of their different geography. The Arctic is a semi-enclosed ocean, almost completely surrounded by land. As a result, the sea ice that forms in the Arctic is not as mobile as sea ice in the Antarctic. Although sea ice moves around the Arctic basin, it tends to stay in the cold Arctic waters. Floes are more prone to converge, or bump into each other, and pile up into thick ridges. These converging floes makes Arctic ice thicker. The presence of ridge ice and its longer life cycle leads to ice that stays frozen longer during the summer melt. So some Arctic sea ice remains through the summer and continues to grow the following autumn. Of the 15 million square kilometers (5.8 million square miles) of sea ice that exist during winter, on average, 7 million square kilometers (2.7 million square miles) remain at the end of the summer melt season. Minimum and maximum sea ice cover for the Arctic and Antarctic These images using satellite-derived sea ice concentration data show average minimum and maximum sea ice during March and September for the Arctic and Antarctic from 1979 to 2000. Seasons are opposite between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres; the South reaches its summer minimum in February, while the North reaches its summer minimum in September. (March is shown for both hemispheres for consistency.) The black circles in the center of the Northern Hemisphere images are areas lacking data due to limitations in satellite coverage at the North Pole. —Credit: National Snow and Ice Data Center, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. The Antarctic is almost a geographic opposite of the Arctic, because Antarctica is a land mass surrounded by an ocean. The open ocean allows the forming sea ice to move more freely, resulting in higher drift speeds. However, Antarctic sea ice forms ridges much less often than sea ice in the Arctic. Also, because there is no land boundary to the north, the sea ice is free to float northward into warmer waters where it eventually melts. As a result, almost all of the sea ice that forms during the Antarctic winter melts during the summer. During the winter, up to 18 million square kilometers (6.9 million square miles) of ocean is covered by sea ice, but by the end of summer, only about 3 million square kilometers (1.1 million square miles) of sea ice remain. Thickness Because sea ice does not stay in the Antarctic as long as it does in the Arctic, it does not have the opportunity to grow as thick as sea ice in the Arctic. While thickness varies significantly within both regions, Antarctic ice is typically 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) thick, while most of the Arctic is covered by sea ice 2 to 3 meters (6 to 9 feet) thick. Some Arctic regions are covered with ice that is 4 to 5 meters (12 to 15 feet) thick. Patterns of Ice Extent The above images reveal another notable difference in sea ice. The pattern of Antarctic maximum sea ice is roughly symmetric around the pole, forming a circle around Antarctica. In contrast, the Arctic is asymmetric, with much more ice in some longitudes than others. For example, sea ice off the eastern coast of Canada extends south of Newfoundland to 50 degrees north latitude, and ice off the eastern coast of Russian extends to Bohai Bay, China, at about 38 degrees north latitude. Conversely, in western Europe, the northern coast of Norway at 70 degrees north latitude (2,000 kilometers, or 1,243 miles, farther north than Newfoundland or Japan) generally remains ice-free. Ocean currents and winds explain these differences. In the Antarctic, the currents and winds tend to flow without interruption around the continent in a west-to-east direction, acting like a barricade to warmer air and water to the north. In contrast, the Arctic region north of the Atlantic Ocean is open to the warmer waters from the south, because of the way the ocean currents flow. These warmer waters can flow into the Arctic and prevent sea ice from forming in the North Atlantic. The waters off the eastern coasts of Canada and Russia are affected by cold air moving off the land from the west. The eastern Canadian coast is also fed by southward-flowing cold water currents that make it easier for sea ice to grow. Snow Cover over Sea Ice Because the Arctic Ocean is mostly covered by ice and surrounded by land, precipitation is relatively rare. Snowfall tends to be low, except near the ice edge. Antarctica, however, is entirely surrounded by ocean, so moisture is more readily available. Antarctic sea ice tends to be covered by thicker snow, which may accumulate to the point that the weight of snow pushes the ice below sea level, causing the snow to become flooded by salty ocean waters. Other Differences Antarctic sea ice does not reach the South Pole, extending only to about 75 degrees south latitude (in the Ross and Weddell Seas), because of the Antarctic continent. However, Arctic sea ice can extend all the way to the North Pole. Here, the Arctic sea ice receives less solar energy at the surface because the sun's rays strike at a more oblique angle, compared to lower latitudes. Water from the Pacific Ocean and several rivers in Russia and Canada provide fresher, less dense water to the Arctic Ocean. So the Arctic Ocean has a layer of cold, fresh water near the surface with warmer, saltier water below. This cold, fresh water layer typically allows more ice growth in the Arctic than the Antarctic. Variations in Extent Both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent are characterized by fairly large variations from year to year. The monthly average extent can vary by as much as 1 million square kilometers (386,102 square miles) from the year-to-year monthly average. In some months, the trends in Antarctic ice extent are statistically significant at the 95% level, although small. According to scientific measurements, both the thickness and extent of summer sea ice in the Arctic have shown a dramatic decline over the past thirty years. This is consisistent with observations of a warming Arctic. This trend is a major sign of climate change in the polar regions and may be an indicator of the effects of global warming. (See Trends in the Environment section). For more information on current sea ice conditions see the Arctic Sea Ice News & Analysis Web page.

Where you will find, for the first time in many years that the net ice field expanse when BOTH ice fields are analyzed increased and the polar ice caps actually gained in 2017. All despite an aggregate increase in mans output of CO2. IN fact, while the arctic has been losing ice on average for 40 years, the antarctic has gained a bit. Perhaps the melting is more likely a result of natural effects like a slight recent ( e.g. last 50 years ) increase in solar activity ? https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/characteristics/difference.html Regardless ... even if the arctic polar ice cap were completely gone and even if WE were the most largely responsible factor ( which is BS BTW) ... you do realize this would result in a DROP in sea levels world wide right ? Try the melting ice cube in a glass experiment one day and then consider that most of the northern polar ice fields are FLOATING and not on land. That brings one to the logical conclusion that the only clear harm its complete melting does is to the polar bears. Not only do you need to prove that its caused by US and its moving at a rate that poses a danger to justify this moral panic ( which no one has done to any convincing degree ) ... one has to also prove its actually BAD for humans and the long term worldwide ecology + ability to grow food in net. An additional assumption the Green's make that is FAR from clearly true.	UC6uiC03C4RBUmXQ1y2owFpA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6uiC03C4RBUmXQ1y2owFpA	1	UgxF1i_kqFtoZsr6Unx4AaABAg	kim weaver

As a result of this our Government in Westminster turned back over 1000 years of basic freedom of speech and the public didn&#39;t even say a thing about it. We have all forgotten the considerable sacrifices of our forefathers made in winning these freedoms and they must be spinning in their graves when they see how easily we have allowed immigrants to distort our culture, presumably the very culture all these immigrants longed for in their quest to enter this country!!!! The Member of Parliament ought to be strung up from the lamp posts of Westminster for their cavalier approach to discarding our freedoms of democracy. It is not too late and they should, along with the Whitehall civil servants, be dragged out from their desks and hanged until dead. They are traitors to our very Constitution.

It was presented as showing a huge step change almost overnight but it was obvious the reason was that the data was just incorrect. They had taken measured values and calculated values and presented them as if they were the same. That isn&#39;t science it is a con trick designed to scare politicians and unlock funding which secures jobs in the climate change industry.

When they were reduced, the global climate became colder. When they were increased, the global climate became warmer. When CO2 levels jumped rapidly, the global warming that resulted was highly disruptive and sometimes caused mass extinctions. Humans today are emitting prodigious quantities of CO2, at a rate faster than even the most destructive climate changes in earth&#39;s past.

Scientists test a question, or hypothesis, and then submit their results to the scrutiny of other experts in their field. That scrutiny, known as &quot;peer review,&quot; includes examining the data, experimental and/or analytical methods and findings. The spirited debate around remainging uncertainties in climate science is a healthy indicator that the scientific method is alive and well, but the fundamental elements of climate change are not indispute.

There is NO other explanation for why the earths ice mass and glaciers are melting: &quot;The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA&#39;s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 281 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 119 billion tons during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade.7&quot;<br /><br />The earth&#39;s temperature goes in long, slow cycles but the recent increase in temperature is unprecedented, with more CO2 in the atmosphere than for millions of years; it held steady until the industrial revolution, and now has exploded. Those who profit from shifting the cost of global warming and its results (climate change and disruption) have funded the anti-science propaganda to thwart legislative efforts to address the problem. So you have a choice: believe an hereditary aristocrat with a degree is classics, believe the Koch brothers who fund anti-science, anti green energy projets, or believe the world&#39;s 10,000 climate scientists. <br /><br />Not one person claiming all these scientists are wrong, or frauds, has taken even one class in climate science. And yet they say, despite overwhelming evidence, that global warming is not happening as the world&#39;s glaciers and sea caps melt and raise the sea level. How tragically absurd...and their heroes.....people who themselves profit from fossil fuels and have never taken one class in climate science. <br /><br />Here is the empirical evidence: &quot;Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and is accelerating slightly every year.<br />Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.&quot; <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/</a><br /><br />This is not computer modeling or tweaking statistics: this is based on empirical observation.

The UN&#39;s climate change software, where the world&#39;s government&#39;s climate change computers are kept, are parameterized. This means they fudge the numbers to get the results they want. The earth&#39;s climate has changed since the day it was formed. We have been through 5 ice ages and are entering our 6th mini ice age...we are cooling. Earth has a history of warming and cooling. I think at first the scientists thought they were doing a good thing and when the warming stopped they had to live the lie. CO2 can&#39;t possibly affect our climate. The most abundant gas in the atmosphere is water vapor and that&#39;s the gas they scientists parameterize or fudge the data on. Dr. John Casey a former NASA climatologist has a video on youtube called &quot;The Dark Winter 640.&quot; It explains what&#39;s happening in detail along with many other NASA climatologists. I highly recommend watching it. To be armed with knowledge is the best defense.	UCGLa9fUGWpEIRfFU4p3Y1Uw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGLa9fUGWpEIRfFU4p3Y1Uw	0

We spew millions of tons of CO2 per day into the atmosphere and oceans. Not to mention large quantities of Methane, NOx, SOx, partially consumed hydrocarbons (PCH), volatile organic compounds (VOC), particulates, radiation and mercury to mention a few. The CO2 is a disaster on many levels, but just consider one: ocean acidification. If we belch out millions of tons of CO2 each day, the oceans and other water bodies will absorb a portion of this and react with water forming a Carbonic Acid. This is reality. If the ocean food chain collapses, then we collapse. This video spends most of time ridiculing the notion of living back in the stone age without fossil fuels. This is a terrible disservice as it ignores modern technology. The energy system of the 21st century will be more powerful, more available (Hydrogen based on water electrolysis), and will have no toxicity. Use as much as you want, and you won&#39;t affect anyone. Lord Monckton is stuck in the 19th century, and can&#39;t open his mind to a better way of powering industrial civilization. Sad.

The general public have a snow flake&#39;s in hell ability to have a coherent conversation/debate. It&#39;s like having too many Cooks in a kitchen. It&#39;s as crazy as cats fighting. ..Someone (in a comment below) has gone quite nuts saying scientific theories can not be proven, only disproven/falsified.....This is my reply: 20181209: You are wrong! .Scientific theories are ideas/hypotheses that have been proven. Proven means: Demonstrated by evidence or argument to be true or existing....Every time you drive a car and see the road is clear to proceed, your eyes are proving to you the road is clear. Deep philosophical questions of reality have NEVER stop me from using proven scientific theories to make my life abundantly pragmatic. I am assured by science that when I go to a flush toilet and shit, my shit goes to Heaven where I will one day join it. Of course, if you can disprove this scientific theory, even if it takes the rest of you life here on Earth, I would encourage you to do so. But please, try adding to Climatology constructively. Put up a good proof and argue it with experts who understand what you&#39;re saying. If I can understand then it probably is not worth being peer reviewed. Unless you are my peer. In which case I&#39;d just start laughing.	UClA6nF1Ksi3UwhXgj1Yr3sQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClA6nF1Ksi3UwhXgj1Yr3sQ	0

A scientific THEORY (let me say this one final - never to be repeated- TIME) is only raised to the high status of a THEORY when the hypothesis is repeatedly proven, over and over - just like your inability to understand. Over and over you do not, can not or will not understand. But there is always doubt. That is integral to the Scientific method. If you can prove the official THEORY is wrong, please do But if you can not persuade like minded experts then by all means try, try, try again. But you're not trying to show any THEORY is wrong. You are trying to show the whole scientific endeavour over centuries past is a fucking load of shit. To which all I can humbly say is, You do not count. Your opinions are no more than a bite of a single mosquito on a colossus. But the power of Science is not found in its size but it's integrity. It's integrity stems from its principles. Especially that it is, in the nature of the beast it is, its self-correction. You prove any scientific principle wrong under any condition and you will be famous. But nothing happens instantly just because you are sure you are right.

The global warming crusade has now reached the point where you will be virtually burnt at the stake for saying it is not true. Marching along with the masses and chanting the same war cries so as to &#39;fit in&#39; with your peers is seen as the easy and comfortable way to be. To say that global warming is a hoax for political ends and control of minds and money is putting yourself above the parapet to be shot at. So be it. Since Al Gore used data, which he mis-represented in terms of cause and effect, for his own political gain (a group of us examined it for ourselves) the world has gone mad. Science knows for a fact that the earth has natural cycles of heating and cooling, some influenced by volcanic emissions or by external intervention such as meteor strike, and that we are in fact overdue for the next ice age by some 10,000 years. A few little egotistical, self-obsessed microbes like humans scuttling around on the surface isn&#39;t going to change any of that! Global political ambition is behind all of it, and woe betide you if you don&#39;t have &#39;GW&#39; tatooed on your forehead.

Go ahead and read what he said about being virtually burned at the stake. You're literally proving his point. Honestly, idk what i think yet.

If it's a conspiracy why has it taken those who understood in the 70s so long to convince the majority? You'r garbled ideas are pathetic, fed by paid liars who want to continue to claim that 'some don't accept' the science, confirmed over and over again. I find it strange that you people still exist. Once there was a reason, few had heard of it and even fewer understood. Now even dim people know it's changing, getting hoptter, rainfall i8ncreasing so much that a year's rainfall falling in 24 hours is becoming a common occurance. At what point will you be forced to face reality? When up to your neck in flood water like millions in Northern India? Don't google that, it might disrupt your complacentcy and disturb your inadequate mind, then you'll get depressed and anxious and consider ending your life.

Our CO2 production means nothing on the global scale. Our air contains 0.03 percent CO2 that&#39;s too little amount to work as greenhouse gas. Only the Sun&#39;s activity can influence global warming. But you can&#39;t get money from the Sun so we better blaim the people for it. It&#39;s always about the money.

Perhaps we should park this debate as it seems to be getting us nowhere and perhaps we should in principle talk about what is good and not good for the environment without the need for proof. This debate has done nothing but divide people and given air to an unending polarisation of communities. If we decide that pollution, CO2, carbon monoxide etc may have consequences let’s discuss that rather than debate the outcome. None and no one will convince the other and we waste so much time arguing to the point. In essence the argument of man made pollution is academic and we can argue to the end of time. Lets park the argument and move on.	UCwzyHat_ef5lAtjoPlDD_FQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwzyHat_ef5lAtjoPlDD_FQ	0

These alphabet soup of organizations<br />include NASA, NOAA, JMA, WMO, NSIDC, IPCC, UK<br />Met Office, and others. Click on the names for links to their<br />climate-related sites. There are also climate research organizations<br />associated with universities. These are all legitimate scientific<br />sources.<br /><br />If you have to dismiss all of these scientific<br />organizations to reach your opinion, then you are by definition<br />denying the science. If you have to believe that all of these<br />organizations, and all of the climate scientists around the world,<br />and all of the hundred thousand published research papers, and<br />physics, are all somehow part of a global, multigenerational<br />conspiracy to defraud the people, then you are, again, a denier by<br />definition. <br /><br />So if you deny all the above scientific<br />organizations there are a lot of un-scientific web sites out there<br />that pretend to be science. Many of these are run by lobbyists<br />(e.g.., Climate Depot, run by a libertarian political lobbyist,<br />CFACT), or supported by lobbyists (e.g., JoannaNova, WUWT, both of<br />whom have received funding and otherwise substantial support by<br />lobbying organizations like the Heartland Institute), or are actually<br />paid by lobbyists to write Op-Eds and other blog posts that<br />intentionally misrepresent the<br />science.”<br /><a href="https://thedakepage.blogspot.co.uk/2016/12/how-to-assess-climate-change.html">https://thedakepage.blogspot.co.uk/2016/12/how-to-assess-climate-change.html</a>	UCESVbw2oUPjlzU8YyT3ghMA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCESVbw2oUPjlzU8YyT3ghMA	0

This hasn&#39;t only happened once, it&#39;s a repeating cycle, we are at the emergence of a warm period I believe, so it gives the climate brigade something to shout about, unfortunately, they don&#39;t want to know the truth of it because it will spoil their agenda. Fluctuations have happened in the past, they will happen again in the future and it will happen with or without our help. I can only hope that there will be something of mankind left to pick up the pieces and start all over again. Rant over.

All of the horrible things that they predicted when it was called Global Warming did not happen. That should have ended the scam. They changed the name to Climate Change and continued to manipulate and cherry pick the things they needed to support the new scam. Now, they can blame the predictions that fail on a changing climate that doesn&#39;t fit their calculations from time to time.

Not because of insane immigration policies as I would think but over the new taxes on petroleum. Gas at a rate of over $7 a gallon means many are losing the freedoms enabled by the motor car. Its all such a plot <br />from the diversity is our strength lie to global warming&#39;s arrest will be made possible if the first world gives billions to the third world. The third world will use this money to better the planet? Of course they&#39;ve always been so good with money. The E.U. and The Kalergi plan. Isreals national court house just had to have a pyramid with an eye on the apex. Wtf is that about, oh and than theres fancy man Macron delivers some imp. speech after being elected. The place of the speech, a museum , the display behind him another fuckin pyramid with a colored light at the apex. Its gotten too stupid at this point. Who really thinks America is crawling with nazis patiently waiting for code red defcon 6. Its lunacy and not that its necessary but Im going to confirm I&#39;m a lunatic( at least to most of you) by my next statement. There are many impossibilities in the holocaust narrative and viewed with a critical unprejudiced eye it lacks basic proofs but makes a thrilling story with living babies thrown on fires,evil scientists and ghoulish soldiers eating lunch on a thousands plus mound of rotting corpses.

What an odd non sequiter to start your post off. It is verbatim a comment on another channel that was translated for me ten minutes ago. It was written in skryllic (maybe) I am not an idealogue and I know the snap judgments leveled at anyone questioning any part of the holocaust. It is the only bit of history that is illegal to critique. An Obama official wanted fines levied at anyone in her dept who did not consider the climate change issue as settled science. Unbelievably Bill Nye wanted jail time for climate deniers. So I see some similarities in the methods of suppresion.

People with common sense call climate change a hoax because it is, & scientifically provable. People deny the holocaust because they are filled with nonsensical blundering ideologies. Remember, hawks also die to become food for the critters, but in the meanwhile fly with fleas.

I didn't mean to indicate ALL PhD's were among those tainted by either social/political biases or the temptation of an easier dollar. To the contrary, most believe they are being ethical. You, as an analog specialist , come from the STEM fields as opposed to the social sciences. It is interesting how quickly you have become defensive in loyalty to your father and likely, your own field that took years of hard, dedicated work to achieve. I applaud you. But do note how you immediately jumped to the anecdotal, which is far more likely to come from someone from the social sciences, whose thesis are rarely acknowledged by peers. Heller and his ilk are simply attempting to stick to as much with statistics as scientifically possible, which no doubt you appreciate. And the paucity of data found outside the U.S. is alarming. Agreed, there are a multiplicity of methods to certain better results. The crux of the query is how much does mankind (the Chinese, Indians, etc) add to the climate mix, and if significant, what can or should be done about it? And if we do attempt to make drastic changes to the free-market economics that have lifted much of humanity from poverty and stavation over the past thirty years, what unintended consequences might arise beyond our ability to make corrections. The main difference between conservatives and liberals is that the former like to stop, check, tweak, and reassess, while Liberals prefer jumping right in and worry later. Both sides need the other. Heaven forbid if only one ruled the day. Be well.	UCbLjEDGdZY-izN0sFy6pb3Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbLjEDGdZY-izN0sFy6pb3Q	1	UgxzSIJwuueg8EQxM8R4AaABAg	bernadette black

Create the perception there&#39;s a crisis. 2. Proffer your own pre-determined, convenient solution to said &quot;crisis&quot;. 3. Lobby your &quot;solution&quot; into law. 4.

But not everyone does, largely because a lot of the politicians (not necessarily scientists) pushing the idea have made so many outlandish claims of disasters that have failed to materialize. And frankly while not everyone opposing the idea is a saint, there seems a lot of conduct on the part of some supporters that understandably leads to questions from the laymen. Calling people who have legitimate questions either about the science or the motives or conduct of the people pushing anthropogenic climate change "deniers" for instance doesn't help convince them...

"Also, the list of who I follow is irrelevant if they present work by actual climate scientists, isn't it?" No its not if they misrepresent the factual science data and that's what the likes of Monkton does time and time again. The O.P has made it it very clear in this thread "Monkton has been proven to be a fraud over and over and over again." The debate has long been over to why our Earth is warming at an alarming rate,more to the point now is how fast carbon reductions can be made to avoid further warming.? reductions of some 45% 60% will be needed next decade and carbon neutral by 2050 although this still represents some 440 ppm atmospheric CO2 2050, there are also other factors to consider lag time a little over a decade, continuing loss of albedo, particulates, CO2 long term Ocean and atmospheric exchange, decreasing biomass and continuing landmass change, remember a long term steady climate state cannot be guaranteed with less than a further degree C in warming. There are only three main drivers regarding climate change Our Sun, Atmospheric GHGs, And Particulates,incidentally our Earth should actually be slightly cooling. Other effects such as Plate Tectonics,Ocean Currents, Biomass, even Our Moon ex have played impart,i suggest you study peer reviewed or pall reviewed scientific literature,regarding all thee above and past,present,and future climate change in relation to adding vast amounts of GHGs into our atmosphere being some 39gt at present taking all factors into account. Now its clear by your above comments you know very little about the subject of climate change,nothing wrong with that because you still have time to research this fascinating subject of Earths history,all the best take care.

The gigatons of methane locked into permafrost is also starting to be released and the data is being recorded. It is easy to think that lords are intelligent but this video clearly shows that ignoring basic data shows a lack of intelligence and the cost of this will come back to haunt the foolish.

As far as I'm aware, Al Gore doesn't have a degree in climate science either - in fact, the majority of politicians don't. The point is that, although this guy is by no means a climatologist, he made an argument supported by statistics that were researched and arranged by actual climatologists. Of course, using this sort of "he has no degree in [insert field of choice]" argument to dismiss well-structured and logical speeches is much easier than structuring a proper reply of your own, with empirical data to back yourself up with, so it's understandable, if not logically fallacious.

Are we so arrogant that we think we can somehow be worse than any of the other animals? As George Carlin said, it&#39;s our arrogance at thinking we are so terrible that we can do more harm than...oh, an asteroid? Or a volcano? A tsunami? a hurricane? And if we did kill our species off by producing some massive climate change, and you think like a Leftist or an extreme radical environmentalist, wouldn&#39;t the planet be better off if we all died off?

Lord Monctons work back then was always refreshing and science backed. <br />There is much more going on in our climate, not manmade at all. This is a political long con. I have since seen the UN and my country Canada among all the others make agreements threatening our sovereignty and rights. I ran in the federal election to stand up for our sovereignty. The Jesuits tried to mess with me, Jesus saved me. Now I see that the Pope is pushing a climate solution with Sunday Worship in place of the near forgotten True Sabbath on the 7th day to honour creation. Long play. <br />My point is that this is a prophetic. Many will be deceived into false worship when political leaders enforce Sunday rest and make Sabbath keeping illegal.

You haven'ty a clue about the environment or you wouldn't be fooled by this old creep who hasn't a clue either, just a lot of inherited money invested in fossil fuels. The Heartland Institute is packed with old men like this, all of them will be dead soon, so why should they worry you saps will suffer? There are no deniers in the countries, usually poor ones in the South, who are already suffering catastrophic climate change. The Maldives are consulting with Australia to accept their whole population as climate refugees when their island 'paradise' home goes under the sea. It's getting too close not to prepare. Africans are increasingly moving north and into Europe and this will increase as temperatures get too high for humans to live. If you're so clued up, how come animals and plants are moving north? You do know they are right? Why is that if it's not happening, are plants too part of the conspiracy? Plants that never grew past a certain latitude are now growing north of it, dying out to the south of it. How does that fit with no climate changes? Animal species also are moving as some can't tolerate beyond a certain temperature range. Go figure dipshit.

We have pumped an enormous amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. 2. The more you change a foundational element in a physical system, the more likely you are to throw the system out of whack. 3. There is a easily supported reason to believe that additional CO2 will increase the temperature (easily proven through experiment). 4. The temperature has been increasing.<br /><br /><br />Given these undisputed facts, what should we do if there were NO models? We should do everything we can to stop changing the fundamental physical constants of an unstable dynamic system, aka, the climate. Electric cars, solar panels, batteries, nuclear plants.

The fact is 1) they can not say how much of the warming is natural, and thus they can never say how much is man made. 2) The alarmist have altered data multiple times and every time it results in their graph continuing to have the exact same slope. 3) Their models based on the sensitivity of the atmosphere being greater than 1 have failed. Any model that has a sensitivity of less than 3 can not produce any risk. That means there is no evidence of a risk to the future generation. 4) There is no consensus of scientist. IF you have ever read any of the reports, it becomes obvious that they are nothing but political statements attempting to convince the public that scientist are all in agreement when there is no such agreement. 5) any attempt to spend money on even the worse case situation would be a failure. Even if we spend 50% of the worlds gdp for the next century, it would only reduce the temperature .1°C from what ever its going to be. 6) Evidence says that the cause of the warming is a recovery from the lack of sunspots during the little ice age and solar models are predicting that the next solar grand minimum will start in 12 years. That coincidentally is when they say we have to spend all this money to fix the problem, or it will be too late. There are more facts that prove that the alarmist are wrong. IF you want to discuss them, I will, but simply denying the facts because you do not like the presenter is foolish. As he said, Global warming is a hoax.

In the 1990's a Russian astronomer discovered evidence we are headed into a new solar grand minimum like what happen in the Marauder minimum. He created a model that predicted what would happen and so far, it has been right on. In 2030, according to that model, the grand solar minimum will begin and it will be decades of temperature falling. So, yea, it is too late.

When you see such desperation as putting Monckton before congress, you know things a very bad indeed. Worse than expected. To top it off, it's too late to do anything now. The Charney Report 1979 - page viii "The conclusions of this brief but intense investigation may be comforting to scientists but disturbing to policymakers. If carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group finds no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible. The conclusions of prior studies have been generally reaffirmed. However, the global climate system, may be expected to slow the course of observable climate change.

But C02 and 'fossil fuels don't cause covertly, yet visibly engineered Climate Change, that is the Lie, as they push so called 'green' 'clean' 'renewable' electric cars by FRAUD. Most of the public's response to helping the (fictional cc-propaganda) is to rush out and buy and electric car, (by design). and deception. Btw our previously beautiful, healing sun has been covered with a so called "Clean Energy' Patent, it's unbearable and no one says a word (seems to notice). I'm sure many do, including teens, children and birds but suffer in silence. Before 3/18 I used to wake up and first thing was, to go out to see the beautiful healing sun and (sungaze) too, and spend long hours outside in the sun, but now I can't (it's permanent chemtrails AL oxide over the glaring mirror). The Solaren Patent is supposedly powering the (now) heavily electric grid and the so called ‘green’ ‘clean’ ‘renewable’ electric car boom, they've tripled in the past 1 - 2 years Prius' and now Teslas are showing up everywhere, and it's all based on Fraud and deception. And so called 'green' rebuilding after the Ca. fires is now mandated all electric and other cities are following suit, beLieving themselves to be ''green,' but the Climate Action Plans are a Universal Template (forced consensus) for UNAgenda 21/2030 (global governance), the Club of Rome's deceptive "Sustainable Development. The Solaren Patent covering our sun, burns my skin and makes me quesy as soon as I face it. I saw the sun change (get covered) the end of 3/18 and saw the Patent and same Launch date 8 months later. It's supposedly utilized by MCE (Marin Clean Energy) recently expanded into other cities and counties (see timeline on their site) coinciding with the Solaren Patent Launch. If you call PG&E for service, to a new home for example, they assign MCE as your "Clean Energy" provider and say you can Opt Out if you want. Also Opt Out of harmful to health "smart" meters and LED lights billions mandated for "the smart grid" by (Fake) Climate Action. They covered our real sun and with a dew weapon it looks like a (harmful blue spectrum) giant LED since 3/18. The Patent: "An orbiting mirror beaming powerful rf frequency from the sun to a power station in Fresno with (constant) deployments of AL oxide." silver white haze covering the Patent covering our real sun. I miss our real sun so much, lots of tears. It looks and feels nothing like our real sun. And the Patent is kept secret, because it's shameful and it’s a Crime Against Humanity and Nature, and in fact is a dew (directed energy weapon). Wifi is dews, 5g is stronger dews, 'smart' meters are dews and dews were used in the Ca fires, and other past destructive 'events. Including possibly WW2 where Germany had their own banks and was firebombed (or dew-ed?) by rothschill central banker and energy baron, current owner of PG&E and other US utilities, owner of the nexrad dopplars and bought Weather Central in '12, ever since then began years of relentless chemtrails, coinciding with the Engineered Drought. In WW2 11 million German citizens were killed as well as countless beautiful Tartarian buildings were destroyed and the evidence of benevolent free energy system buildings of the Previous Civilization.

If people agree to "go-green" it means people can be taxed more for the greater good. They can make us live lower quality lifestyles like smaller houses, no personal car and bugs to consume just because doing otherwise would be "selfish" and "bad for the environment". It's the perfect loophole for power; if you disagree with what they want then you are against the people and will be punished. Just look at this Greta girl. You can't criticise a child, right? Why is she asking all these Western nations to lower emissions when countries like China contribute more than a THIRD of all C02 emissions in the world?

Burning fossil fuels, methane produced by feeding and rearing livestock for meat, changes in the sun spots and heat output, even alleged visits to our solar system by alleged planetary bodies from outer space. If we had not used fossil fuels, we would not have been able to produce the energy for heating and manufacturing all the consumable goods or transport out of season foods to feed the burgeoning world population, so whilst renewable sources of energy are on the increase, most of the plastics, clothing, chemicals etc we extract from fossil fuels we use have been sourced from fossils.<br /><br />The planet is currently suffering from a pole shift, which is an event that occurs every 300,000 – 600,000 years (See NOAA web site <a href="https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/">https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/</a> and tick the box &#39; Modelled Historic Track of the poles&#39;) This is the cause of the escalation of crazy weather, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It is also reducing the strength of our protective magnetosphere allowing more UVA, UVB and UVC to reach the surface of our planet, causing alterations to DNA, burning plant matter and increasing the threat of skin cancer.<br /><br />Governments and the media are keeping quiet to stop mass panic, however, the millions that are currently losing their homes and possessions to fires and floods have not been warned to keep their critical documents safe in water and fireproof boxes and suffer horrendous problems proving their identity and paying for copy documents. If you are travelling abroad, please check the weather forecast for your destination before you go!”<br />The costs of the current increase in extreme climate events already exceeds the economic cost of recovery, so many will fail to recover. There is a possibility that the world economy could collapse as more and more food and manufactured &#39;essential&#39; goods become scarce.<br /><br />There are many sites on You Tube which document the increase in crazy weather events.

I copied this: "Thus the net effect of clouds on the climate is to cool the surface by about 5�C, at least under the current global distribution of clouds. Clouds reflect about 50 W m-2  of solar radiation up into space, and radiate about 30 W m-2  down to the ground, so the net effect is 20 W m-2 cooling on average. This greatly exceeds the 4 W m-2 warming due to doubling the atmosphere�s carbon dioxide from 300 to 600 ppm, or the roughly 2 W m-2 cooling caused by aerosols". We are heading into a colder period for the next 30 to 40 or more years. We are already seeing it, last year in the US Midwest we saw average temperatures 8 degrees below normal.  We saw rivers freeze in South Korea that never freeze.  We saw Russia and the British in a deep freeze.   So food supplies will be less, massive people in poor countries will die and wars will break out over food supplies.  You and YouTube are doing a great disservice with your propaganda.

Also explain how a local measurement is a valid indicator of global temperatures..... The climate models are performing quite well actually: https://ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter8.pdf 'Grand Solar minimum': neither grand nor minimum....... You tell me, how do the sunspot numbers relate to the amount of energy emitted by the sun? A GSM is a 0.1% reduction in solar intensity..... less than a Watt of forcing on earth! 'You have done a great disserve to mankind by your lies' Well, it is interesting when people claim cooling while the temperatures are rising. If people cannot read a simple graph......

Greenland's million of years of ice core samples reflect climate not local weather.  You can not possible know that CO2 accelerated warming since none of the UN climate models came even close to predicting temperature. Of course temperature's and CO2 are going to raise we are after all coming out of the bottom  (lowest temperatures)of an ice age.  From the Cambrian to the Cenozoic  periods during the last billion years other than when we were going into, into or coming out of an ice age global  temperatures averaged 25 degrees Celsius, we are currently at 14 and going lower due to the Grand Solar minimum. You need to tell people to prepare for food shortages.  Your lie that increasing temperatures are going to kill people pales in comparison to the number that will die from starvation and the killings and war as the result of fighting over food.  You have done a great disserve to mankind by your lies.  You too YouTube your liberal agenda will spread misery through out the planet.

CO2 increase follow warming not proceed warming. MOSTLY true in NATURAL cycles. In the cysles you are talking about, we know what triggered the warming. We also know that the then released CO2 accelerated the warming. At present the situation is different as we are triggering the CO2 release.

The scientific method, technology, dreams and the right to speak truth to power have lead us to an amazing world with a bright future for our descendants. The world is getting better. I agree that we need to stop polluting, however capitalism, a form of technological innovation along with other innovations are already helping to clean up the world. Tomorrow will be better than today, however today is pretty damn amazing.	UCRY_6aJ5-vzdiAcjA-cVshA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRY_6aJ5-vzdiAcjA-cVshA	0

UgwbBKWiyTJRJvGxLFx4AaABAg	5	23	2018-10-03 04:52:12	CHILLIN DILLAN	After 1992 UN CLIMATE SUMMIT ACHIEVED &quot;CONSENSUS&quot; from 192 countries it had permission to use its DELPHI METHOD to calibrate SOCIETY for its NWO format to control &amp; destroy us with SOCIAL ENGINEERING to believe what isn&#39;t true &amp; unable to believe what is true. IS THIS YOU? GEORGE ORWELL&#39;s &quot;1984&quot; began after 1992 UN CLIMATE SUMMIT! )I-[&quot;WE MUST WAKE UP UN is the 1%!&quot; THE TRUTH ABOUT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT – TRANSLATING THE ‘FEEL GOOD’ DOUBLE SPEAK<br /><br />UNBuildingNY<br /><br />In September 2015, the United Nations held the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol – to address climate change. In this meeting, they introduced the first of its kind – it basically set new guidelines for emissions reduction and efforts to stabilize greenhouse gases. There are 191 countries who are implementing this new framework, and I am writing this to explain what exactly is in this bill.<br /><br />I found 2 documents on the UN website – the first is UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, and the other is the United Nations General Assembly. When you read the document, it sounds good – a lot of warm and fuzzy phrases like ‘sustainable development’ and ‘eradicating poverty’, but the people at the United Nations and you and I speak a very different language. I have learned how to translate some of this, I am translating it from what they are saying, and what they really mean. While reading the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol document, I arrived at page 3, and got an error message that denied me access – so, I am wondering why they would publish this document on their website, only to restrict access? So, I am working strictly from the other document (and I will post a link at the bottom of my article).<br /><br />This document basically outlines their ‘goals’ for Sustainable Development. Their first goal on this list is ‘End poverty in all its forms everywhere’. Now, that sounds great – I believe the world would like to see an end to poverty. But, we must remember, this ‘goal’ is coming from the people at the United Nations, and these are the same people who concluded that climate change is occurring because there are too many people on the planet, and these problems are being caused by man. So, how exactly do they intend to end poverty? Well, they don’t exactly tell us in their outline. They sort of leave these goals open ended, not much explanation of how they intend to achieve these ‘goals’.<br /><br />There are over 60 of these ‘goals’ outlined, I am not going to translate each and every one, there are a few on here I think are important enough to highlight. In order to translate the language here, one must understand who these people are, and what their real agenda is. And in my previous blogs, i outline that. This document is one of the most insidious documents I have ever seen. I have seen the NASA war document (I will leave a link below), the Iron Mountain Report, the Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars document and a few others. The reason I find this one to be the most offensive, is how they are masquerading their agenda. It is deceptive. These people will lie about the data, the statistics, the science, and even falsify history to achieve their goals. Their biggest concern is ‘too many people on the planet’. So when I see things like ‘eradicate poverty’ – one must read between the lines. How do they intend to eradicate poverty? Well, let’s find out.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, their objective is to reduce everyone’s carbon ‘footprint’ – and this document tells us how exactly they plan to get each and every last person on this planet to do their part. Remember, this isn’t just some idea, this has been the law since September 2015, so many of these objectives are already being rolled out.<br /><br />On page 14 of the UN General Treaty document lists 17 of their ‘goals’ – the first one listed states “End poverty in all its states, everywhere”. Now, that sounds great. I think everyone would like to see that, but again, they don’t tell us how they intend to achieve this. So, let’s interpret it. The way the people at the UN see things, first and foremost, there are too many people on the planet. The way they intend to ‘end poverty’ would be to end the 3rd world. How they are already achieving this is via mass migration into the 1st world. They have no intention of making any improvements to the 3rd world (if they did, they would have helped them long ago, for example, Africa is rich in resources (oil, minerals, diamonds, precious metals, etc) and there is no way the people who are behind this intend to allow these countries to develop, so they will migrate as many of them into the first world as possible, and force them to assimilate to UN Agenda 2030 laws. For the people who aren’t migrated, I believe they will be left to fend for themselves. In other words, I believe their interpretation of ‘ending poverty’ is ending people. Make sure these masses are all on food stamps and government housing, so they are entirely dependent on government, self reliance is unsustainable.<br /><br />Goal #2 states, “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.” I think I can interpret this one quite easily. One of the objectives in the UN Agenda 21 document implies ‘false scarcities of food, energy, water and other resources’ so when we see ‘end hunger’ – I believe that means, they intend to starve out as many people as possible, so there won’t be starving people left to deal with. “Nutrition and sustainable agriculture”, that’s easy. Translation for this is simply “Supply the masses with GMOs (sustainable agriculture), and ensure that nutrients are declared illegal (oh, this has already occurred – see Codex Alimentarius, this is a trade commission that has already declared nutrients illegal – all food now is irradiated, that includes all fresh food).<br /><br />Goal #3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all at all ages.” Translation: Vaccines at gunpoint, heavily medicate all children with antidepressant and ADHD drugs, educate using the Common Core dumb-down-the-masses curriculum, re-write their history into a false history so they never learn the truth about freedom.<br /><br />Goal#5: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” Translation: Criminalize Christianity – demonize males, promote LGBT, gender fluidity and ‘gender is dead’ propaganda, shame masculinity and heterosexuality, and feminize society as a whole.<br /><br />Goal #6: “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.” Whenever I see ‘for all’, I want to cringe – it is a very communist phrase (Obamacare for example, ‘Healthcare for all’ -remember?). Translation: Corporations seizing control of all water, energy and electricity – rationing supplies to the masses, only providing minimal amounts. All the while, criminalize, coal, gas, and oil production – promote wind and solar energy (which has proven itself a failure).<br /><br />Goal #7: (see Goal #6)<br /><br />Goal #8: “Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.” Translation: Regulate small business out of existence, force employers only to hire LGBT, transition to a dictator-based economy, more government regulations and mandates.<br /><br />Goal #9: “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and promote innovation.” Translation: Drive nations into debt to the World Bank, spreading corrupt corporatism to build large scale infrastructure and trap developing nations into unending debt. Punish the wealthy, confiscate all gains from those who choose to work in the private sector Redistribute confiscated wealth from the working class to non-working human parasites who contribute nothing to society, all the while, demanding “equality”.<br /><br />Goal #11:” Make cities and human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable” . Translation: Ban all gun ownership by private citizens and put them into hands of obedient government enforcers, who rule over the impoverished serf class. Criminalize all rural property ownership and relocate them to Hunger Game style fenced-in electronic concentration camps called “Megacities” which are surrounded by restricted areas, under 24 hour surveillance, educate the masses to ‘snitch’ on their peers. (ie: ‘If you see something, say something)<br /><br />Goal #12: ” Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.” Socially engineer reduction of consumption by creating false scarcities, burden violators with heavy fines, use TV, social media, and movies to shame those who use too much and do not conform (in California, they have an app for your phone, if someone is over-watering their lawn, you are encouraged to take pictures of the persons’ home and upload pictures, shaming the individual), encourage tattlers to report harmful activity in exchange for subsidies.<br /><br />Goal #13: “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.” Translation: Set energy consumption quotas, criminalize and punish negative lifestyle decisions that exceed energy usage limits set by the government. Institute total surveillance via ‘smart meters’ where we can track and calculate energy consumption. Penalize private vehicle ownership and force masses onto public transit where TSA grunts and facial recognition cameras can record the movement of every persons’ activity.<br /><br />There are many more ‘goals’ set in this document. I hope this was a short course in “Interpreting U.N. language into what they really mean.” I am hoping to publish Volume 2 soon.

Heck I even predict a mini ice-age and soon (within 10 years).<br />The reason for the push for green energy etc is definitely to line pockets of the rich. Time and time again they find ways to drain the funds of the poorer residents of the planet. They have only one source of money and it&#39;s us.<br />In the UK it suited the government just fine. The UK government had a tough time (aww what a shame!) with the coal miners. Sure there were strikes but they were for genuine reasons. I bet people don&#39;t realise that in the UK, for the last 2k years, we have only extracted around 5% of our proven coal reserves!! That&#39;s proven - there is coal beneath the North Sea and from England to Holland. There is enough coal to last thousands of years and we can be self-sufficient. Coal isn&#39;t dirty - governments lied to all and told them it couldn&#39;t be clean but it can.<br />Now we see our fuel bills drained to pay for green energy projects and once built we don&#39;t get the money back or a lessening of the bills - why should we pay for companies to benefit twice? It&#39;s because the rich have interests in them and governments do NOT represent the population. Governments represent the interests of corporations..

Fossil fuel companies admit it, and have been shown to have known about it for at least 60 years. There is a federal lawsuit now moving through the courts to force the end to the use of fossil fuels. It has surprised a lot of government and f.f. lobbyists who are now shitting their pants.

He thinks that a carbon fee where the sum is paid out equally to all citizens is a conservative solution to the problem. NOAA and NASA are not "falsifying" the data. These are rumors. The Permian extinction (which killed 95 % of species on earth) is a well known event caused by the global warming that ensued from a massive eruption of volcanoes. We are on track for a similar irreversible event. This is not sensationalism...all that scientists have to do to see this is to note concentrations from the past and compare it to where we are headed. Radical left doesn't mean wrong. I don't care about politics so much, but I do care about future human life being locked in for extreme suffering. Look. If you don't believe in global Warming, then consider the following. Before humans started chopping down the forests and burning fossil fuels the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was at 280 parts per million. Now it is at 409 parts per million (where it is climbing at 3 parts per million per year thanks to emissions). It was otherwise stable at 280 parts per million for 10,000 years. If we get to 1000 parts per million, then you wont be able to open your window anymore to get fresh air, because 1000 parts per million is the threshold where humans can detect that the room is too stuffy. Give that some thought. And if you don't believe me do a Google search for "nasa CO2" and you will see the graphs that show that the CO2 concentrations really are growing that fast and if you google "CO2 stuffy room threshold" and you click on the first link you find, you will see that 1000 parts per million of CO2 to 2000 parts per million of CO2 are concentrations that cause complaints of drowsiness and poor air. Forget global Warming if you don't believe in it. WE ARE RUINING OUR AIR!!! I gave good evidence and I made it easy for you to follow up on it. Please reconsider your policies.

The planet is a living thing, just like everything on it. It moves through cycles. Of course it&#39;s going to warm up and probably destroy all life on it, and then it may cool down and freeze for millions of years before starting the process over again and again. That is unless it just destroys itself, or we destroy it? (because we&#39;re pretty good at making bombs and shit like that) But &#39;GLOBAL WARMING&#39; F*** OFF!!! WHAT A RIP OFF!!! GET REAL!!!!!

Our demise is already baked into the cake, even if we stopped driving cars, and shut off every single coal fired power station. In fact, that wouldn't even help. We need the particulates in the atmosphere to dim solar radiation, which has a profound cooling effect.

The dangerous cold global warming. It is -26 in the Arctic Bay right now, so Im affraid the arctic cold did not just move. It is -22 in Thule, Greenland, ever wondered why it is called Greenland by the way? The all time heat registration is from 1913. The Earth temperature has been in a steady decline since the holocene optimum 7000 years ago, interrupted by 3 warm periodes all warmer then now. You are a fool if you fear the lifegiving warmperiodes and the plantproducing carbondistribution called CO2. Your argumentation is like a 6 year old with a sugar fit.

The top 3 being in recent years. 2018 had plenty of high temp records broken e.g. Scandinavia. Australia has had plenty of heat records broken recently e.g. Port Augusta, almost 50 degs celcius, on the south coast. We've had prolonged heatwaves. Perth is having one at the moment. Yes there has been extreme cold like Chicago recently, like minus 50 fahrenheit. But its just spillage of cold air from the Arctic with the loose jetstream, that has been dipping south, right down to Florida. Average world temperatures remain high despite the extreme cold in certain areas.

He has a scientific experiment proving his cosmic ray theory and coallating data to back his theory up. It was Scientific progress that proved the Earth to be round and it will be scientific progression that will blow off the climate hysteria. 2018 was cold, 2019 is colder, 2020 will be freezing, Trump knows it and the American people will feel it. Just in the right time for the election. So you can kiss your climageddon fantasy and your utopian marxist dream goodby and cry yourself to sleep when Trump gets reelected in 2020. Now watch the temperature drop over the next 15 - 30 years. Witness the IPCC run out of hot arguments, and see how flatearth alarmists like yourself go extinct. Real science will always win.

I've had thousands of views. I'm just a regular schmo, but I understood climate change before Al Gores first movie. Greenland contributes at least 1mm of sea level rise annually.

Hardly any respected scientist, if any, would support your assertion that ice on Greenland has been climbing since 2012. Ice in Antarctica is not 'ok'. These days scientists have multiple ways of measuring the ice volume with satellites n shit. They can measure the gravitational force. In 2019 it's not appropriate to be polite to ignorant fucks that don't even acknowledge that mankind is changing the climate. The science has been known since around 1847, when we were getting around with a horse and cart.

But even if all the sea ice in the world melted, it would not cause ocean rise. Only inland ice is gonna cause a rise. Greenland inland snow/ice sheet comes and goes but has been climbing slowly since 2012. The antarctic rockisland never drops below zero so ice is ok there too. Calling people who dont believe the World is gonna end “deniers”, is meanspirited and dum. So, keep doing that and make a fool out of yourself. The fact that it is not socialy accepted not to believe in climageddon among the left, just says it all.

Antarctica has lost 270 trillion tonnes of ice according to the peer reviewed literature. Deniers like to talk about Antarctica because it's more complicated with increased precipitation. More snow in the middle. And spillage of ice into the ocean. Look up the Totten glacier. Sounds like that alone could make a serious contribution to sea level rise. The truth is that Antarctica, Greenland and the Arctic are haemorrhaging ice in spectacular fashion. Many gigatonnes each, with acceleration.

You may not call it the religion modernism but you most definitely sense a particular phenomenon that is in fact a religion – just as Marxism and socialism are religions. The reason that religion generally is sinister or maleficent is that it gives rise to or incubates the disease "I – am – right", which disease has brought about more death and destruction than any other disease. Nearly all religions regard their beliefs assumptions presumptions and norms as being catholic (or universally held), and moreover they almost invariably seek to make their beliefs assumptions presumptions and norms compulsory, and you can easily identify religion or religions by their heresies and sacred cows. For the purposes of the religion modernism it sacred cows are beings of the passive sex – women, homosexualists and various other paraphiliacs and those of darker skins (that fantasy that they call race{that does not exist, there being no such thing as race})What happens is that like bacteria religions tend to multiply and divide just as the religion modernism now includes a number of some religions such as wimminism homosexualism anthropogenic global warming_ism and multiply like bacteria and infect people like bacteria so they tend to act as diseases	UClUzuXPevsirEm6Ncyc95Eg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClUzuXPevsirEm6Ncyc95Eg	1	Ugylysl7IXcD6e-lWx14AaABAg	Marcus Gable

It's speeding up as was forecast, and very soon it could you you experiencing 'unprecedented flooding' or suffering drought. The climate system is going into meltdown. You may not have understood, but past 'civilisations' aka cultures that left a mark, usually in stone, caused their own demise by trashing the environment they depended on. When things went bad they sacrificed children to their gods, but that didn't work either. Now they are buried among the forests that came later when all had perished.

The idea that men(human beings) could*possibly* affect or influence the climate is pure religious mubojumbo, of the " we have offended de gods" variety.

They mentally think they are living a back-to-nature lifestyle in a remote log cabin in the Rockies by owning a Jeep and don&#39;t want the climate to ruin their imaginary, progressive lives. Most of their Jeeps have never been put in 4-wheel drive nor been near a mountain. They cling to the climate change myth because it provides an escape from their miserable lives much like the Sierra Club stickers on their Jeep windows represent their imaginary lives in a cabin outside of Crested Butte where they sip hot chocolate by an open fire or go horseback riding among the Aspens.

Not to mention the fact that they hurt fish populations. With dams blocking the fishes routes to move, many can’t migrate and die.

Second, the Venus comparison was not saying that Venus is anything like earth, that’s completely preposterous. I simply proving that CO2 has a profound impact on climate using Venus as an example. And, what do you think CO2 acts differently on Venus than it does on earth. Whether on this planet or any other, CO2 increases the temperature of the planet. That’s what a greenhouse gas is. Third, why do think that the danger of global warming is that the earth is warming? That makes no sense, the earth has warmed and cooled since its existence. That’s not the threat. The threat is that the globe is warming at a never seen before rate. .9 degrees C in just a century. That’s insane.

Megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans, the world's seas were up to 100 feet higher than they are today, and the global average surface temperature was up to 11°F warmer than it is now." If you look at the chart you linked to, you will note a general trend for the last 140 million years: as CO2 decreased (with ups and downs but as a longterm trend), temperatures decreased until a few hundred years (with the Industrial Revolution and burning of fossil fuels), a sudden spike, the famous hockey stick, showing a sudden increase (much faster than ever recorded) along with increase in CO2. You might also note that about a billion years ago, a dramatic rise in CO2 led to a dramatic increase in temperature. Past variations had multiple causes such as volcanic activity, solar activity, etc but the recent rapid (in geological terms) rise in temperature is linked to the rapid rise in CO2 as result of burning fossil fuels in the past 250 years with no volcanic or solar activity sufficient to explain the rise: greenhouse gases are raising global temperatures, causing glaciers and ice caps to melt, creating all kinds of climate disruptions from flooding to drought to human migrations. \ It is possible to find times when CO2 and temperature moved in opposite directions but only because of offsetting solar or volcanic activity, which is NOT the case today. The only logical explanation for rising temperatures is human activity, according to almost all climate scientists with perhaps 2 or 3 percent saying we need more data to draw conclusions.

Second, game misconduct for irrelevant comparison. Comparing to Venus to Earth is like...uh.....comparing Venus to Earth. As I suppose you are aware, Earth also had much higher levels of CO2, like 1500 ppm, and temps were cooler than today. And, sometimes temps are real high while CO2 levels are low, and vice versa. Sometimes CO2 levels and temp move in opposite directions during the same periods of time. There's no doubt we're adding CO2, and the CO2 GHG warming theory is generally accepted (there are some who contend the 19th century CO2 GHG theory does not exist in our open system. I have no opinion on that). We have H20 oceans that play a key role in climate. Does Venus? Does any sunlight reach Venus' surface?

They will not allow the poorest countries of the world to get cheap forms of energy: coal, hydro, nuclear, etc. because it will add to global warming, therefore they live with no electricity.

I'll watch the temperatures, the co2 levels, the ocean pH. the vanishing glaciers (aka the elimination of spring fresh water supply to millions), the vanishing coral reefs (ie the loss of livlihood of millions of islanders, the increase in energy in the semi closed system causing more severe weather events, the spread of tropical diseases north and south (depending on the hemisphere) . But hey, go play with your ego and your feelings. ........ sometimes it's impossible for someone to look into the bathroom mirror and see th scab over the eyes because .... the scab is over their eyes (that is referring to you just in case you are too dim witted to realise it)	UCslvaYYGe78OjoDr3LrlafQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCslvaYYGe78OjoDr3LrlafQ	1	UgywPJ3U0XUHYlYxQPF4AaABAg	Open eye

Yet they know they are millions of years old and they knew what the climate was like through soil samples, then you have the sun and the solar system which influence our climate not to mention continental plates shifting under the ocean which moves land mass over time which can influence the jet streams. So do your research and not that of the mainstream media and governments who pump out propaganda for you to feed of.

It takes place over time, we can only slow down the process but not stop it. You want to know what terrible things can happen? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming “Climate change has already impacted ecosystems and humans as well. In combination with climate variability, it makes food insecurity worse in many places and puts pressure on fresh water supply. This in combination with extreme weather events, leads to negative effects on human health. Rising temperatures threaten development because of negative effects on economic growth in developing countries. The social impact of climate change will be further affected by society's efforts to prepare and adapt. Global warming already contributes to mass migration in different parts of the world.” “Many physical impacts of global warming are already visible, including extreme weather events, glacier retreat, changes in the timing of seasonal events (e.g., earlier flowering of plants)” - Earlier flowering of plants literally refers to the first article you linked.

Why the fuck would you multiply 3% into 0.04%? What you’re doing is obviously full of shit, done so to make the number smaller and appear less significant. A common political tactic that plays with real numbers to obtain a final figure that gives the opposite impression that the real numbers represent. Ok, let’s not talk about why you did that. Let’s talk about your argument that humans did not contribute a figure substantial enough to push us over the edge. Here are some evidence I easily found online that I quote: “Some climate change denial groups say that because CO2 is only a trace gas in the atmosphere (roughly 400ppm, or 0.04%, 4 parts per 10,000) it can only have a minor effect on the climate. Scientists have known for over a century that even this small proportion has a significant warming effect, and doubling the proportion leads to a large temperature increase.” “Human emissions of CO2 are now estimated to be 26.4 Gt per year, up from 23.5 Gt in the 1990s, according to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in February 2007 (pdf format). Disturbances to the land – through deforestation and agriculture, for instance – also contribute roughly 5.9 Gt per year. About 40% of the extra CO2 entering the atmosphere due to human activity is being absorbed by natural carbon sinks, mostly by the oceans. The rest is boosting levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. How can we be sure that human emissions are responsible for the rising CO2 in the atmosphere? There are several lines of evidence. Fossil fuels were formed millions of years ago. They therefore contain virtually no carbon-14, because this unstable carbon isotope, formed when cosmic rays hit the atmosphere, has a half-life of around 6000 years. So a dropping concentration of carbon-14 can be explained by the burning of fossil fuels. Studies of tree rings have shown that the proportion of carbon-14 in the atmosphere dropped by about 2% between 1850 and 1954. After this time, atmospheric nuclear bomb tests wrecked this method by releasing large amounts of carbon-14.” None of the fucking papers you linked actually disproved this. I suggest you actually read through them with more discretion before you actually come here to try and prove a point. For example, your first paper is literally less than a page on my phone, and all it stated was that C02 increase might not necessarily be bad for *plants*. Holy shit, that does not even link back to your argument. Do you even actually use your brain and properly read the papers or are you just linking them to support your unfounded claims.

Pose a question. 2. Collect data to answer the question. 3. Present an answer to the question.” I’m only commenting here because you said science isn’t data. Sorry pal, you can tell us that they faked the numbers but saying that the numbers don’t prove anything because it isn’t science is pure brain dead nonsense you say to back up your claims.

Papers R not going to help unless U UNDERSTAND the ACTUAL SCI!!! If U actually took the time to fing time to LEARN what the Sci means, how it applies, what physics and gas laws R applicable and WHY then it just might start making sense! Posting papers because its from your favorite site means U dont KNOW WTF U R talking about!!! U obviously dont know enough to know what the IPCC knows and does not know... There is a reason ppl go to school and use textbooks and reasons why Textbook published ACCEPTED Sci is used even in fields not related to the subject... ITS because textbook Sci has already passed the controversy and its become a gold standard in Sci by consensus! U on the other hand cant evaluate whats right whats wrong because U never learned the BASICS to begin with!!!

There are many more peer reviewed papers, read them. Instead of swallowing the lies of the IPCC, why don't you read what actual scientists have to say. You are just a random on YouTube, I've got no idea who you are, your words mean nothing. http://climatechangereconsidered.org/ These people don't have an agenda, they are non political and they are watching the IPCC.

I saw an abstract which kind of ask how closely is CO2 tracking warming. 1st off and U said U agree CO2 DEFINITELY causes atmospheric warming... Arrhenius equation has a formal mathematical proof accepted over 70 yrs ago. Whats in question is how much can the earth due to compensate for extra CO2... Thats where data and everything from cows to human reproduction comes into play. But whatever the data is we know that more ppl, more air conditioners, more meat consumed, less natural ice etc etc these R all positive feedback probs that R in interplay. So the idea is to drive these down to a minimum until the rate of temp rise can be controlled and possibly reversed, but since we cant say for sure that negative Carbon emission is possible we must stop pushing our luck...

The fact that other factors such as ice melting leading to less sunlight being reflected back into space... melting ice may release lots of permafrost with a huge decomposition base releasing lots of CH4 (much more heat absorptive than CO2), etc etc... U seem to be locked in on single cause single effect. Its not that simple... This is positive feedback but feedback with a multitude of driving forces acting in a nonlinear loop. So maybe what U R trying to figure out exactly where a tipping pt is... Its really hard to quantify, But so far temp rise has closely followed Svante Arrhenius. equation in going from 280 ppm to 415 ppm CO2. Thats to be expected because its CO2 mostly (65% according to the EPA) but other gases less prevalent but even more heat retentive definitely play a lg roll. My pt is just because its just 3% (doesnt sound like much) but since we may have stretched the earth's buffering mechanism to its limit this can be a huge prob...The best ex that comes to mind is think of your blood when drinking OJ... OJ has an acidity a PH of 3 yet your blood must maintain a PH of 7.35 - 7.45... Yet you can drink OJ (to pt) and not die because of PH buffering. But U can only buffer so much. Eventually U pass the buffering limit and it breaks down and U fall apart and go into a coma because your blood will be too acidic (low PH)... That is what we R facing with CO2 in the atmosphere. If your pt is this isnt just about CO2, like maybe this is over pop too. I agree with that. Its oversimplified by the media, as Sci usually is, but like when U drink the last glass of OJ that puts U over the top and there is too much acid in your blood its the same for earth and too much CO2. Its a circular argument about what causes warming... does too much CO2 cause the warming or do too many ppl burn too much crap that actually puts the CO2 there in the 1st place? Its a chicken egg argument which means over production of CO2 needs to be stopped period.... See?

But here is a fact chk done on your psuedo sci source popular technology from Snopes.com, even they call it out as “pseudo” Popular Technology is a news website that focuses primarily on climate science, which is odd as their name is related to technology. The founders and contributors to this website all hold Ph.D’s in a variety of scientific fields, unfortunately none of them are within the field of climate science. While not directly stated, the primary mission of this website is to debunk the consensus that climate change (global warming) is occurring and is strongly influenced by human activities. Popular Technology only publishes research articles that are contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change. Interestingly, they side with the consensus when it comes to 9/11 conspiracies about how the Towers fell. Overall, per our policy, any source that rejects the known consensus of science is placed in the pseudoscience category. (D. Van Zandt 8/27/2017)Source: http://www.populartechnology.net/ Ultimately if U R going to claim CO2 cant cause warning then U would have ro be able to show how the formal math proof is wrong...

Wildfires out of control in Alaska, Siberia and the Arctic; unprecedented temperatures across Europe, and the Heartland Institute, a fale gang of old men funded by Exxon-Mobil are both senile, investers in fossil fuels and liars. They only convince the really stupid, people who have difficulty studying anything, even finishing junior school. There could never be a conspiracy involving tens of thousands of highly educated and experienced scientists across a wide range of disciplines around the world, to accept that you have to be certifiably paranoid and most likely schizophrenic. Or just too dim to tie your own shoelaces. As global heating builds and builds, these old fossils are looking more and more like the ridiculkous and sick old men they are, and anyone falling for their anti-science drivel are the bottom feeders, mouth breathers and knuckle draggers, largely in the US & Australia which appear to have a monopoly of lowlife retards.

What you don't understand is that climate change is being used as a scam to control nations, increase the cost of living, and take away the sovereignty of countries for a one world government. CO2 does not cause the climate to change, and is not a pollutant. It is a necessity for life on earth. Most of the fires in Australia are started by people, I know this because one particular fire they lit was wet and struggled to burn. But they still forced people in the area to leave their homes even though the fire was no threat. Some of us know exactly what is going on, and what is going to happen. But people like you who reject God are fucked.	UCeJanGa6J4G6BK_A7JtMNkA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeJanGa6J4G6BK_A7JtMNkA	1	UgywPJ3U0XUHYlYxQPF4AaABAg	Open eye

They used the RSS data, since it showed a lack of heating of the biosphere for a decade or so. They engaged in the very-unscientific technique of cherry-picking. Turns out that the RSS satellite was in a decaying orbit, so it was taking temperatures at 5pm, instead of the planned 2pm local time. They had to admit that their work was tainted by the technical flaw. They developed an algorithm to correct for the years of ever-later readings and bingo! The RSS feed was right in line with the other four data sets. That eliminated the "no heating for (fill in the blank) years" nonsense. That didn't help their case or reputation.

The greenhouse effect was identified in around 1847. And is undisputed within the scientific community. Any conspiracy would have to involve 10's of thousands of scientists, AND their lab rats, all keeping quiet and receiving regular bribes. Perhaps they meet in abandoned buildings with dark sunglasses. The real money trail points to the big oil companies like ExxonMobil, Shell and Gasprom, that make billions, even receive huge subsidies on top of their profits. Some deniers think it's all about government grants for scientists, like these scientists drive around in sports cars, and sail around tropical islands on their private yachts. Just look at glacier retreat ffs. The acceleration. Melting Ice is completely unbiased. The purest form of data there is.

This is a way of taxing people massively and stopping the third world from developing by denying them the essential fossil fuels which have been so abundantly provided for us. The ice core samples show that the temperature rises some time BEFORE the CO2 rises. I think there is currently about 0.04% CO2 in the atmosphere, and where is it more abundant, food is more abundant. Apparently the growers of marijuana know this and pump it over their crops. Climate is massively complex with the Sun and Gulf Stream and all those volcanoes under the sea, and lots more. But you can't tax those things, can you? Your travels sound very interesting, but I beg to differ with your conclusion - otherwise as somebody said "We'd better collectively all hold our breath".

There is no correlation between co2 and global warming other than co2- increase happens long after global warming. And we are now entering a cooling trend after a slight increase in temperature (0.8 Celsius) after the little ice age. And that beneficial warming ended in 1998. Leave politics out?😁 this is politics from day one, sir! One could recommend ten, or more books and hundreds of scientific paper and articles about the subject, but one assumes that the authors would be labelled as "paid-by-fossile-fuel-companies, right-wingers or whatever.

I knew that wasn't true because that summer and the 3 before were actually cooler summers because of the extra rain and cloud cover. It was far hotter about 40 odd years ago when we used to have heat waves that lasted 2 weeks at a time, where the sky was dark blue without a cloud being seen. There are other reasons for what is happening in the Great Barrier Reef, and there are those that are saying it is something else. There has always been fires in the hotter months in Australia, and they are mostly lit by someone. Fires don't start automatically with 35 to 40 degree temperatures.

I did present facts that your IPCC reports are not science. What is man made climate change? Is it geo engineering chemtrails, or H.A.A.R.P? I know it is not CO2, and if they want to claim that it is, they better start giving us proof. I doubt they would have any idea what causes the climate to change. Your statement "The simple fact is CO2 is now 409ppm and it's never been above 300 since homosapiens have been around." Is actually unknowable because science is determining facts through observation. I know all about the global warming climate change scam, which is designed to take the sovereignty of nations away for the good of humanity and an unelected one world government. The New World Order is a fact, and all governments are serving this new communist dictatorship of slavery. All the answers to the climate change scam is not restricted to science either, it is blatant mind control of the population. If there was global warming and excess CO2 the globe would be greening, because the heat would cause more rain, and plant life would flourish with the excess CO2.

Those who do question speak on behalf of their dark masters. Inherently evil they peddle fossil fuels, all who question MMGW are thralls of sulphur, gnashing teeth and CARS! So currently our atmosphere is at a very low concentration of carbon dioxide. Serious climatologists do not equate storms with climate change. The industrial revolution shouldn't be scapegoated because its additions were negligible. The internal combustion engines and its transformation of life in the 20th century is the real beginning of anthropomorphic alterations to atmospheric content. What does this mean for our future ? IDK and neither do you. As far as ice Antarctica isn't losing ice and the other pole is currently gaining ice. Coral like warm waters and the sea level is rising ata rate consistent with projections made before your religion of doom took root. One last thing why do they still build large costly condos. and such on flat coastlines, why do the insurance companies still write policies for these structures. Its because they know the truth because they belong to the ruling class stop being a donkey.

The scientific evidence is overwhelming but with the extreme weather etc denying it is like denying gravity. I have dived the Great Barrier Reef since the 1970's and the majority of coral is now dead or close to. Australia is now in extreme drought and there wild fires everywhere. Many more than California even. Summer has only just begun and already all time temp records are being broken. I was also in Japan this year and they had the worst heatwave on record which also affected Korea and China followed by a whole bunch of typhoons. Climate deniers will only be able to stick their heads in the sand for so long.	UC_5PMDpRneYZjcPn4YeP1Pg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_5PMDpRneYZjcPn4YeP1Pg	1	UgywPJ3U0XUHYlYxQPF4AaABAg	Open eye

I have nothing personal against you or any climate denier so let's please stick to presenting facts. The IPCC have just released an extensive scientific report which is made up of unpaid scientists chosen for their expertise. You and I can debate it all day long and I know you will find a scientist probably on FOX who will support your argument but 97% of scientist say the evidence for man-made climate change is undeniable. The simple fact is CO2 is now 409ppm and it's never been above 300 since homosapiens have been around. This rise has only occurred since the industrial age. There are now dozens of markers which climate scientists agree on. If you went to 100 doctors and 97 told you that you had cancer and 3 said you didn't what you are saying is you would believe the 3. Again this is not personal. I know you believe what you believe but if you have evidence that proves climate change is not real please share. Thank you.

Solar minimum is a fart in a hurricane. The average range of temps. during a minimum is a measly 0.26C swing over decades. That will go unnoticed in the midst of this much hotter world. The sun IS almost the only source of heat on the planet. The TSI is very slighly down..... about 2.5w/sqm out of an average of 1365 w/sqm. This has been going on for about 35 years. During the same time, the biosphere HEATED up by about .85C. So heating is NOT due to more heat impinging on the atmosphere, but rather that the atmosphere is not allowing as much radiation to escape, therefore raising the temps. This will make your Denier head explode...... having more snow, or snow at odd times and places, is EXACTLY what is predicted in a heating world. What is snow? Frozen water falling out of the sky. How does water get into the sky? Evaporation. What drives evaporation? Heat and pressure. Mostly heat. More heat, more moisture, more precipitation (snow, sleet, hail, rain). That's right, when the buffoon Sen. Inhofe held up a snowball in the Senate, he was making the OPPOSITE point compared to what he thought.

The sun is heading into a solar minimum and most likely a grand solar minimum. The sun has and will always be one of the main drivers of our climate here on earth. CO2 is not a huge greenhouse gas problem. We have bigger fish to fry. All I am saying, I guess is IMO is let's give it a year or two and see what the weather brings. If I am right, not only did we break 100 year records all over our country for snow totals and low temps this year, but it will get progressively worse with each passing year as we descend deeper into the minimum.

Temps. of the Jurassic would render most of the Earth uninhabitable for humans. A LITTLE more CO2 in a controlled environment will slightly raise the output of grain and green leafy vegetables. But that is in an environment where moisture, heat, water, pests, soil composition, insolation, and other factors are controlled. In the real world, the heat and climate disruption caused by GHGs REDUCES yield and diminishes both protein and micronutrient content of the grains, particularly wheat and rice. Corn, barley, millet not as much. So you have to eat more of the reduced grain harvest to get the same nutrition you used to get.

Quantum mechanics and laboratory studies along w/ the US Navy's long history of development of heat seeking missiles proves that CO2 has a very important role as a greenhouse gas. Without wv, methane, CO2 we would not exist. Also, If temps were not rising then how can one explain the retreat of 90% of earth's glaciers, ice sheet melt, and loss of sea ice extent during these last two solar minimums? Carbon fingerprinting also makes it clear where the carbon is coming from as if we really need evidence of that.

It was otherwise stable at 280 parts per million for 10,000 years.". Yet, despite your stable CO2 levels, temperatures presented this level of variability: http://jonova.s3.amazonaws.com/graphs/lappi/gisp-last-10000-new.png And on a longer time scale, the lack of correlation (causation?) is clear: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/co2_temperature_historical.png?w=720 Clearly there are other forces at work here that we do not fully comprehend. Many legitimate climate researchers doing bona fide research readily admit this, yet "alarmists" continue to rely on CO2 as the primary cause for warming. Consider how incorrect the projections of temperatures rise have been compared to actual when reliant on CO2. And let's not forget how life flourished during periods of much higher CO2 levels tens of millions of years ago. I see one group of scientists approaching this with scientific skepticism, proposing falsifiable theories in the spirit of the scientific method, while another group contends the science "is settled", relying on fear of what might happen if we don't act, while employing "tricks" to "hide the decline". More of your words: "but the more we wait to do something about the problem, the more severe the measures would need to be to prevent severe problems from climate change." I would whole-heartedly agree with you if the science were truly settled, but I (and many true climate scientists) hold the same skepticism, as it should be. Your warning contains two fundamental assumptions: 1) that there is a "problem", and 2) CO2 is the cause, and reducing emissions will fix it. As I've shown above, there is enough legitimate scientific evidence to at least shed doubt on 2), and there is no way to know whether 1) is a problem or a benefit. I also find it VERY curious and disturbing that more money is not used to research the effects of the Sun, the oceans, or water vapor. Industrialization produces lots of water vapor.

You need decades, specifically a minimum of 35 years of data to detect climate signals accurately.

Before humans started chopping down the forests and burning fossil fuels the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was at 280 parts per million. Now it is at 409 parts per million (where it is climbing at 3 parts per million per year thanks to emissions). It was otherwise stable at 280 parts per million for 10,000 years. If we get to 1000 parts per million, then you wont be able to open your window anymore to get fresh air, because 1000 parts per million is the threshold where humans can detect that the room is too stuffy. Give that some thought. And if you don't believe me do a Google search for "nasa CO2" and you will see the graphs that show that the CO2 concentrations really are growing that fast and if you google "CO2 stuffy room threshold" and you click on the first link you find, you will see that 1000 parts per million of CO2 to 2000 parts per million of CO2 are concentrations that cause complaints of drowsiness and poor air.

It is actually new way to enslave the tax payers.<br />Look at what is going on in the sky&#39;s! They are spraying chemicals in the sky with neurotoxins. <br />Everybody can see this phenomenon every day happening in the sky’s. While military planes are making chessboard chem-trail patterns in the sky’s all over the planet, spreading around neurotoxin’s with only one goal! To serve the extreme rich, who possess all in the world, not being satisfied to make them even more richer! Their goal is to enslave people (like in George Orwell’s book “1984”) to make the sky’s so polluted that they will ask the taxpayers more money so that the taxpayers can breathe fresh air.<br />We all have to stand up and protest. We should not pay any tax anymore until these basterds stop spraying toxics in the sky’s.<br />It has been proven that the occurrence of Alzheimer diseases is exponentially exploding all over the world, that organisms are dying with a speed unprecedented.<br />All of that due to chemtrails<br />Stop this chemical cleansing and stop paying tax! <br />Join the movement of Patrick Roddie<br /><a href="https://stopsprayingus.com/">https://stopsprayingus.com/</a>	UCJdbIrjv5DzN_WpPlX26u2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJdbIrjv5DzN_WpPlX26u2g	0

Before humans started chopping down the forests and burning fossil fuels the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was at 280 parts per million. Now it is at 409 parts per million (where it is climbing at 3 parts per million per year thanks to emissions). It was otherwise stable at 280 parts per million for 10,000 years. If we get to 1000 parts per million, then you wont be able to open your window anymore to get fresh air, because 1000 parts per million is the threshold where humans can detect that the room is too stuffy. Give that some thought. And if you don't believe me do a Google search for "nasa CO2" and you will see the graphs that show that the CO2 concentrations really are growing that fast and if you google "CO2 stuffy room threshold" and you click on the first link you find, you will see that 1000 parts per million of CO2 to 2000 parts per million of CO2 are concentrations that cause complaints of drowsiness and poor air. Forget global Warming if you don't believe in it. WE ARE RUINING OUR AIR!!! I gave good evidence and I made it easy for you to follow up on it. Please reconsider your policies with respect to our CO2 emissions.	UC_NlA1tUXHnYMjOsd3gjkZw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_NlA1tUXHnYMjOsd3gjkZw	1	UgwsucftvK46jD3mBJt4AaABAg	John Smith

Al Gore quotes the 400 PPM concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere as proof. What does that mean? Elementary school kids get it. Just to torture his 5th grade teacher a local science fair student posted Gore’s 400 PPM ratio as 400/1,000,000 = 40/100,000 = 4/10,000 on his science fair poster (5th grade math). Then placed in front of it a large pickle jar filled with 9,996 white marbles and 4 black marbles and ask the question, “Does anyone really think 4 CO2 molecules in 10,000 has any significant impact on our climate?” The teacher wrote a large red “Grade – D” on his poster for all to see. We now live in George Orwell’s “1984” dystopia.	UCIErzgkRiP_V3K-la9OoA8g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIErzgkRiP_V3K-la9OoA8g	0

So perhaps we should be grateful that there is a little additional warming going on. Looks like a correlation with the number of sunspots, with fewer sunspots giving lower TSI.

The text with the curve states that the annual rise is in line with the amount of burning of fossil fuels. But that rate is hardly moving while human emissions have become exponentially higher. For CO2 as well as other GHGs. At this point in time, if the effect of those gases is as assumed, then we would be in a runaway hothouse right now. We're not. Even with the 30-40 year lag. Even with the particulates from burning stuff. I agree with the 'it's complicated', as per IPCC's non-lineair chaotic system, but that also means CO2 is not the only driver and the importance of CO2 is actually near zilch. (per Tyndall's experiments that assigned 2/3s of warming to water vapor and 1/3rd to the other gases.) My money would be on the big kahunas, sun and ocean and the interaction of those two.

But here's something I keep coming back to: the past 20 years with the rise of China and India we've burned more fossil fuels and emitted more CO2 than in the 150 years before that. Yet the CO2 levels show a steady rise from the 60s (320) to 400 (2013)... So what does that mean? Is that a delayed effect? Or is there something else going on? I'm pretty sure there's a human part in rise of CO2 ppm, question is, how big is that part? I mean, exponential addition of CO2 by humanity, lineair rise of CO2 in ppm. Is the signal getting lost (meaning human contribution is too small to be noticed)? Is there some kind of equilibrium that we have too little knowledge of right now?

If we stop burning coal to reduce CO2, we significantly reduce the particulates and aerosols that are now providing at least 0.6C of dimming (cooling). Stop burning coal and we will be over 2C. within two years, WITHOUT any other inputs of GHGs. Keep burning coal and the CO2 alone will finish us.

There is no reason to assume that anything we grow for food will survive anywhere in the new conditions that are coming at us at rocket....not glacial.....speed. The heating after a glacial period has taken place over thousands of years in the previous 10 heating events in the last 800,000 years. During those heating events, the atmospheric CO2 has increased by a mere 100ppm or so over the 5,000 year interval between the bottom of the glacial period to the peak of the interglacial. 100ppm increase in 5,000 years. Human activity has raised CO2 by 130 ppm in about 150 years and it raised it from the PEAK of about 280 ppm to 410 ppm instead of the "natural" heating events that take it from 180 ppm to 280 ppm. We have jumped up from the top of the mountain, instead climbing up from the valley. These conditions are unprecedented in human history. OH, and the usual source of CO2 is still not emitting a net positive amount.... the seas are still taking up CO2. When the seas start to be net emitters of CO2, the concentration will increase even more quickly. Then there is methane which has nearly tripled in concentration in about 50 years, yielding a CO2equivalent of 550ppm. We KNOW that the soils of northern boreal forests are very thin and poor, unsuitable for agriculture. Then there is the problem of a higher angle of incidence of the sunlight. The higher the latitude, the weaker the sunlight, reducing photosynthesis. You can't just move the farms. Greenhouses are a huge investment in money, maintenance, and carbon. There is no way to grow the vast amount of corn, wheat, rice, soybeans, sorghum that the US, Canada, and (for now) Australia produce in greenhouses. There is no reason to assume that greenhouses will enhance conditions for growth, as the bulk of the problems will most likely be from too much heat, not too much cold. The current rate of climate change is 10,000 times faster than evolution can handle.

So many of them that we drown out the stars at night. We feed large parts of Europe with those green houses. And still we manage (like the rest of the western world) to throw out 50% of it, because not 'nice' enough or no market for it. It could get warmer, it could get colder, we would still grow huge amounts of food. No matter where in the world. For the climate bands to shift in the way you suggest, how much warming should there be? 6-7 degrees? And with more land coming available in the northern hemisphere, how much of that land is not suited or well suited for grain? Answer: we don't know. Much of it is permafrost right now, or desert or steppes. What happens to rainfall patterns? What happens to soil erosion? Again, with the glacial pace of current climate change, we will adapt. Civilizations that could not, perished. Or the people moved to a place where living was easier. We're still here, after more than 10.000 years of climate change, with hotter and colder periods. I guess we managed. And now we have advanced technology. You're trying to find solutions already for a problem that may take 200-300 years to develop. Good, although maybe a bit premature. Also, 'temperate zones overheat', how does that happen? Living in a temperate zone myself, if it gets hot, water evaporates, clouds form, sun gets blocked, it cools down, maybe a thunder storm or two. It's a nice system, pretty neatly regulated, keeps us within temperate bands. So again, mountains and mole hills. The only certainty I have is that you and I will not be alive to witness any of it.

They do not thrive in hotter or drier climates, or in higher CO2 concentrations above 550 ppm. When the temperate zones overheat, and we try to take our wheat and corn fields up north, we find that the soils are not compatible and the amount of actinic light that drives photosynthesis, drops off because of the more oblique angle of incidence. That is an insurmountable problem, unless you build huge banks of mirrors to direct light onto crops that would not have otherwise fallen on the fields. But that means that the indigenous plants will be killed by being shaded. @Mike Jansen	UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	1	UgiHNJQtIRuMGHgCoAEC	david williams
UgiHNJQtIRuMGHgCoAEC.8VK9Mx_8j6O8qGH6EELVDC		0	2019-01-18 22:49:51	kim weaver	​ Mike Jansen Tectonics and paleoclimate The Miocene saw a change in global circulation patterns due to slight position changes of the continents and globally warmer climates. Conditions on each continent changed somewhat because of these positional changes, however it was an overall increase in aridity through mountain-building that favored the expansion of grasslands. Because the positions of continents in the Miocene world were similar to where they lie today, it is easiest to describe the plate movements and resulting changes in the paleoclimate by discussing individual continents. In North America, the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountain ranges formed, causing a non-seasonal and drier mid-continent climate. The increasing occurrences of drought and an overall decrease in absolute rainfall promoted drier climates. Additionally, grasslands began to spread, and this led to an evolutionary radiation of open-habitat herbivores and carnivores. The first of the major periods of immigration via the Bering land connection between Siberia and Alaska occurred in the middle of the Miocene, and by the end of the Miocene the Panama isthmus had begun to form between Central and South America. Plate tectonics also contributed to the rise of the Andes Mountains in South America, which led to the formation of a rain shadow effect in the southeastern part of the continent. The movement of the plates also facilitated trends favoring non-desert and highland environments. In Australia, the climate saw an overall increase in aridity as the continent continued to drift northwards, though it went through many wet and dry periods. The number of rainforests began to decrease and were replaced by dry forests and woodlands. The vegetation began to shift from closed broad-leaved forests to more open, drier forests as well as grasslands and deserts. Eurasia also experienced increasing aridification during the Miocene. Extensive steppe vegetation began to appear, and the grasses became abundant. In southern Asia, grasslands expanded, generating a greater diversity of habitats. However, southern Asia was not the only area to experience an increase in habitat variability. Southern Europe also saw an increase in grasslands, but maintained its moist forests. Although most of Eurasia experienced increasing aridity, some places did not. The climate in some Eurasian regions, such as Syria and Iran, remained wet and cool. During the Miocene, Eurasia underwent some significant tectonic rearrangements. The Tethys Sea connection between the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean was severed in the mid-Miocene causing an increase in aridity in southern Europe (see next paragraph for more on this). The Paratethys barrier, which isolated western Europe from the exchange of flora and fauna, was periodically disrupted, allowing for the migration of animals. Additionally, faunal routes with Africa were well established and occasional land bridges were created. Africa also encountered some tectonic movement, including rifting in East Africa and the union of the African-Arabian plate with Eurasia. Associated with this rifting, a major uplift in East Africa created a rain shadow effect between the wet Central-West Africa and dry East Africa. The union of the continents of Africa and Eurasia caused interruption and contraction of the Tethys Sea, thereby depleting the primary source of atmospheric moisture in that area. Thus rainfall was significantly reduced, as were the moderating effects of sea temperature on the neighboring land climates. However, this union enabled more vigorous exchanges of flora and fauna between Africa and Eurasia. Antarctica became isolated from the other continents in the Miocene, leading to the formation of a circumpolar ocean circulation. Global ocean and atmospheric circulation were also affected by the formation of this circumpolar circulation pattern, as it restricted north-south circulation flows. This reduced the mixing of warm, tropical ocean water and cold, polar water causing the buildup of the Antarctic polar ice cap. This enhanced global cooling and accelerated the development of global seasonality and aridity. Stratigraphy The Miocene was first recognized and defined by Charles Lyell in the early nineteenth century. While examining rocks in the Paris Basin, he noted that different strata contained varying percentages of living mollusc species. The Miocene consisted of layers in which only 18% of the fossils were represented among living mollusc species. Stratigraphy within the Miocene, as with much of the Cenozoic, is often defined on a highly regional basis. Terrestrial faunas are recognized in ages which vary from continent to continent, primarily because the animals themselves varied from place to place. These ages are usually defined on the basis of the land mammals, so that North America, Europe, Australia, etc., each have their own Land Mammal Ages. Read more about the North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA) on Wikipedia. For marine stratigraphy, diatoms and foraminifera are the primary groups used to recognize ages. By this time, both groups were abundant and diversified globally, so much so that diatomite is a common marine sediment of the Miocene. Because the diatoms are abundant, and make up a large portion of many marine deposits, they are particularly useful for identifying the relative ages of fossil deposits.

Where did that come from all of a sudden? You base this on some climate change that is mostly beneficial so far? You know, I worried about the first climate articles to appear in the papers and magazines I read, 30 years ago, that told of the coming warming and the accompanying disasters. Guess what. No prediction in any newspaper has *ever* panned out. Manhattan's still there. Not under water. North Pole too. Polar bears thrive. Earth has greened some 15%, sea level rise is what you might expect after a LIA. We were supposed to have peak oil about a dozen times in the last 50 years. We were supposed to be starving every year since 1970. None of it happened. Maybe humans just aren't very good at predicting the future. I heard from a wise man that predicting the future is very hard. Oh, and I *do* believe we could be a little nicer to our planet. Less polution would be good.

Then die. When the social and technical infrastructure collapses, who takes care of the dams, chemical plants, nuclear plants? There will be no way to keep 450 nuclear power reactors and 1300 fuel bundle cooling pools from going Fukushima. That radiation load ALONE would be enough to make most surface dwelling vertebrates extinct.

The more atmosphere you have, the larger its heat capacity. And depending on the mixture of gases you have more or less IR upwelling and downwelling radiation. It keeps our world at around 14C to15C, in stead of -20C. It has been warmer in the past. It has been cooler in the past. Warming and cooling have moved faster in the past as well as slower. Seriously, looking at a bit of (so far pretty beneficial) warming over a few years in stead of geological scales is so futile. Climate's been changing for billions of years, but *now* it's a problem?

Unless you find a way to dramatically increase temperature year round, that will not happen. Unless you manage to crank up temperatures by 9-10K, which does not even happen in the worst of models. Only then will you approach your exponential melt. It would require complete breaking of the laws of thermodynamics. Can't create heat out of nothing. There are limits to solar input, especially at higher latitudes. For the largest part of the year Greenland and Antarctica are WELL below zero C. As in freezing, as in -50 to -60C. And it's not like Greenland is already inhabitable, like it was in medieval times. Makes you wonder how warm it was then. And what caused that warmth then? As for Antarctic lakes. They occur during summer. Apparently. And we know this is special because we have aerial pictures dating back hundreds of years for comparison to see what is 'normal'? Same goes for glaciers in the tropics. Some melt. Some grow. Who cares? Still many questions for something that is supposed to be settled.

It won't be steady, it will increase at an exponential rate beginning with the first blue ocean events in the Arctic. There are now surface melt lakes on the Antarctic surface, just like Greenland. The largest glacier in Antarctica, the Totten glacier is thinning dramatically, much faster than thought. Ice mass loss from the Greenland sheet is now 6 times faster than was expected 50 years ago. Permafrost in the Arctic melting much more quickly. Ocean heat down to 2000 meters, at least, is rising.

By the way, Judith Curry (co-author) was an AGW warming proponent until she started paying attention to the data. She's now a skeptic, and doing real research. Here's an example of some real research. Excerpt: " ABSTRACT [1] Trends in the satellite‐derived Arctic sea ice concentrations (1978–2002) show pronounced decreases in the Barents/Kara Seas, between the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, the central Sea of Okhotsk and a portion of the Hudson/Baffin Bay by ∼2–8% per decade, exceeding the 95% confidence level. Qualitatively speaking, positive phases of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) produce similar ice changes in the western Arctic, but opposite ice changes in the eastern Arctic. The manner in which the ice changes are related to the AO and ENSO are demonstrated. Over the last 24 years, the magnitude of the ice changes associated with the positive AO trend and the negative ENSO trend is much smaller than the regional ice trends. Thus, more local or less understood large scale processes should be investigated for explanations."

What about before that? Why don't we stop name-calling and stick to facts, like the arctic ice records since 1900. If CO2 is the theoretical cause of the decline, how does that theory account for the large drop in arctic ice between 1905 and 1935? https://i0.wp.com/www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/AO-DJF-cumulative-since-1900.png And then there's the other side of the story, which seems "conveniently" to have been omitted, i.e., the Antarctic: http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2000/09/Figure6b.png It's not the facts that are in dispute, it's the causes. And, leaving out relevant facts undermines the credibility of your "argument".

That's not science, that's propaganda. Real scientists are constantly skeptical when it comes to theory, which this is. And regarding the mythical "10,000 climate scientists" and the 97%, that is pure statistical manipulation.

How do we know that the increased CO2 is caused by human activity, specifically burning fossil fuels? If you had watched a few of potholer's vids (I recommend you watch ALL of them) and you will encounter the concept of isotopic ratios. I am NOT going to force feed your concepts and data, you have to now take the ball and run with it. Another way we can know that the increase is anthropogenic is because fossil fuels are commodities..... they are extracted, measured and sold based on the weight or fluid volume. So we have a good idea how much fossil fuel we burn, we know what the yield of the combustion products based on the chemistry of oxidation of carbon. We also know the volume of the atmosphere. With a bit of arithmetic, you can calculate the expected increase due to CO2 emissions. YOu can confirm with a study of isotopic ratios.... the relative ratios of C12, C13, C14. More C12 and the carbon is known to be older, isolated from biological activity for millions of years. @Christopher Marshall	UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	1	UgiHNJQtIRuMGHgCoAEC	david williams

NO, CO2 output is NOT lower. It flattened out for a few years, but last year saw an increase and so far, this year is worse. CO2 output because of human activity is now 41 billion tons per year. And climbing. The only satellite data that indicated a lowering of surface temperatures was the RSS feed which the borderline deniers Christy and Spencer of the UAH chose the one data source that was the outlier in the data sets. It was the only one that showed cooling. They built a whole bunch of speculations based on BAD DATA. The satellite supplying RSS with data was in a deteriorating orbit. The sensors were supposed to measure the surface of the planet at 1 oclock PM local time. The decayed orbit meant that the sensors were turning on at about 5PM. It's considerably cooler most times in most places at 5 pm compared to 1. Eventually, they had to admit to the fuck up and when they corrected the data to account for orbital decay, the data set fell right in to agreement with the rest of the data models. So, the "hiatus" was bogus, as that was pretty much the only source of the push to claim that there was a "pause". Guess what? NO PAUSE. There WAS a pause and even reduction in heating from the end of WW2 and 1975, but then the CO2 was high enough to launch the temps in a very rapid rise. But the cause of that is also well known and gets down to changing atmospheric chemistry. @Christopher Marshall	UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	1	UgiHNJQtIRuMGHgCoAEC	david williams

I understand a fair amount of basic science and I can also perform basic arithmetic. So, YES, I can figure out how much heat it takes to melt 200 billion tons of ice. We will start with an assumption that all the ice is at 0C. One metric ton is 1000 kg. One kg is 1000 g. So, one ton is 1,000,000 grams. A billion tons is a quadrillion grams. 200 billion tons is 200 quadrillion grams. It takes 79.3 calories of heat to melt a gram of ice where you end up with melt water at 0C. So, let's round to 80calories and we get the final answer...... it takes 16 quintillion calories to melt that much ice. See.

I am certain you have not had oneimlass in climate science and yet you proclaim that the world's climate scientists are all fakes. What is your evidence? I accept nothing but peer-reviewed studies by accredited climate scientists. Facts are facts, whether you believe them or not. Global warming is an empirical fact and human cause is the only logical explanation. I suggest you read the NYTimes oped by former climate skeptic (and actual climate scientist, Richard Muller, who was hired by the Koch brothers, the world' leading climate denial funders, to find the flaws in the official data...and he found it was rock solid....https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate-change-skeptic.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=17B0E3E785D283B9177251A81D05E92E&gwt=pay&assetType=opinion I would prefer to believe actual climate scientists who do peer-reviewed research rather than someone who has never had one class in the subject and asserts that he is right and they are all wrong.

Modern science based on evidence, empirical observations, and the self-correcting device of peer-review has been perverted (Stalin, Monsanto, etc) but always has corrected itself since it began a few centuries ago. Are you suggesting the empirical evidence for global warming and the only plausible cause of human activity are the same as ancient myths? Science may err but in the modern age, it has always corrected itself, and since there is empirical observation to confirm global warming and no other reason for warming than the increase in greenhouse gases by human activity, I think there is no reason to believe that the Koch brothers are right and the world's 10,000 climate scientists are all wrong.

All the politicians and all the corrupt "scientists" involved in the AGW scam KNOW it's a fraud. But they're committed now, so will never admit to it. If they had any intelligence I would recommend they read Ablaze, which describes what happened to the Soviet government and technocracy after Chernobyl. Decades of lies backfired as no one believed them when they really needed it. And the same thing will happen to the world wide political and technocratic class now. No one believes a word they say after all the lies post-9/11. They can whine all they want, and do. But it won't change a thing.

Once you start digging, and start uncovering the different agenda&#39;s that are being played out, you cannot go back. You begin to see things in a different way. Once you realise how corrupt the governments are, who controls the money and banking, how information is being suppressed, particularly around treatments like cancer, who controls the media, and how we are being manipulated by it (if you let it), who creates the wars, and so on, your perspective changes. The only way we will get through all this is by coming together. We are all human beings, regardless of the colour of our skin, nationality, or religion. Only when we refuse to &quot;co-operate&quot; with those who are trying to impose their will upon us, and start showing some tolerance and compassion to each other, will things change. That is our strength! Do your homework, and start putting the jigsaw pieces together, and remember, we ARE the 99%!

Climate gate was busted wide open and revealed the fraud of hiding data, oh trust us believe our data! Well can we see it? No just trust us... Funny how the climate scam always has fraud and manipulation of data or concealing of data isn't it? It crops up time and time again... Okay another example, Fraudster Mann's lawsuit against Tim Ball, court says okay Mr. Mann show us the hockey stick data to validate it and prove you're not a fraud... Mann refused, therefore Tim wins the lawsuit and his statement that Mann belongs in the state penn rather then Penn State is justified and a fair assessment! Like I said Gee it's real curious why there so much shiftyness and not being forthright from the alarmists isn't it? Yet you expect us to side with your dodgy fellows rather than with the people that are being forthcoming, not hiding or omitting or manipulating data, and merely just presenting us with the truth! It's easy to see who's full of it and has things to hide, and who is showing it out there for all to see! So stop pretending it isn't obvious where the truth lies, and where the lies stem from, because it is obvious and no amount of word salad and talking your way out of your busted and caught up situations that keep recurring will change this! Want to get caught committing fraud again and come up with b.s. excuses trying to explain your way out of it again? That's all you can look forward to, since the truth is not on your side, that's all you've got!

The side effects of having nuclear are like having a cold whereas burning fossil fuels is like bubonic plaque (if I were to make an analogy). GO NUCLEAR GO NUCLEAR!!! I didn't suggest a tax by the way. A FEE ON FOSSILE FUELS AT THE FIRST POINT IT ENTERS THE ECONOMY! If you don't burn fossil fuels (e.g. commit ecological sins) then you make money! ;) Do you get it now? You can cleverly avoid that money leaving your hands if you play your cards right. Everyone would have the right to choose whether this money is redistrubeted from them or not. Do you see the light? Regarding whether or not it is "our fault". I say it's humanity's fault. Not your fault (because you have been deceived). It is Al Gore's fault because he keeps flying around in his private jet and can't stop eating his burgers while he knows it is a problem! I am sorry but the earth will not cool any time soon. The energy inbalance (energy going in vs. energy going out of the earth system to space) is 1 watt per meter square (we have been able to measure that) and that means more warming is in the pipeline. This energy balance is due to the increase in concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which has been added by humans. The stability for of the last 10,000 years I was referring to was with respect to the global average surface temperature of the entire earth. There have been some more significant local variations such as the midevil warm period and the little ice age and during these earlier periods it was the sun that decided the climates fate for the most part. The CO2 removal method is extremely expensive. The reason the governments of the world won't pay for it to save our asses is the same reason they don't reduce emissions to save our asses (no business incentives; requires sacrifice on the part of the nations willing to pay for it in a world where we try to compete instead of cooperate). The reason it has been suggested that we prioritize reducing emissions over techno fixes that suck CO2 out of the air is because we are not certain that these technologies can be scaled up to the amounts needed to make the necessary difference. As long as people don't get the problem, the politicians will continue to get away with kicking the bucket further down the road with respect to our responsibility to actually do something about the climate crisis. You are right that you are not an idiot. You should be very angry at those assholes who have decieved you.

UggbEflQijINy3gCoAEC.8UwUUtdviSj8p-RHEwwnYV		0	2018-12-18 13:20:16	Patrick Lincoln	@David Collins: You write: "You do if money is the cause" My response: There is nothing I can say that will convince you of the truth in this connection so I will attempt to respond to other points with verifiable truths. You wrote: " Not all scientists agree the 97% consensus is inflated." I must be in another echo chamber, because all of the people who get a significant amount of attention in social media that believe the consensus is inflated have a tendency to deny some of the most basic facts surrounding climate change and as such, I don't trust them on this point. You write: "The man made part is more half and half. NO real answers to the dilemma besides we're doomed, tax us and take away our freedom." Why not enforce a carbon fee applied at the first point a fossil fuel enters the economy where the sum of the fees is paid out evenly to all citizens. This is then not a tax, and you can earn money by being environmentally freindly. The fee can be made to rise with time so that businesses and people will see the future and thus innovate accordingly. Then the markets will due the hard work of solving the problems for us. This solution is championed by climate scientists like James Hansen, but has been very hard to get the governments of the world to implement (because of corruption and special interests). After 8 years of lobbying the organization citezens climate lobby has finally gotten Canada to agree to such a scheme in October (which will be implemented in 2019). The first country to take this reasonable path. This is a real solution. Since the WTO (world trade organization) has in advance given the green light to charge carbon fees on imports from other nations, you can motivate other countries to have their own carbon fee by initiating a carbon fee within your own borders. Please join your local citizens climate lobby to make a difference. You write: "Strange they don't mention this stunt has been done before or the absolute bogus claims that aren't science. The planet goes through climate change: Hot and cold." My response: The climate has been very stable for the last 10,000 years (scientists have mentioned this). But before than, quick changes between HOT and COLD were the norm (scientists have also mentioned this; so it is not like scientists have been ignoring this fact). Other human races such as Neanderthals had larger brain cavaties than us. But they didn't discover agriculture. Why? Because you need a stable climate to predict the seasons, the flooding of the Nile among other factors which are climate dependent. We are leaving this stable time now by warming the world and who knows how much longer it could have lasted. If we are smart and get our emissions under control, then we could take control of the climate to our favor (which is what I want to see happen). Right now we have a situation where fossil fuel burning (for bogus reasons like...it will keep the economy growing) is prioritized over climate action. And that is sad, because at some point (which may have happened already), we wont be able to fix it anymore). I hope this makes sense to you.

Since then, scientists have further refined their understanding of the greenhouse effect and the role our rising carbon emissions are having on it. From the first Earth Day in 1970, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen 24 percent. And because carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, the impacts of our emissions today will linger long into the future.<br /><br />Chief among the impacts is the rise in the global temperature. That’s why countries around the world have agreed to limitthat warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures.

But our species and civilisation is losing the stable climate we have had for hundreds of thousands of years. The planet oscillates from 12-22 degs celcius. We are currently fast approaching 14 degs, on its way back to 22 degs like in the dinosaur age. Most of the time, humans have had temps closer to 12 degs. The real issue is that plant and animal species can't adapt anywhere near fast enough to current change, which is accelerating. Our species is losing its habitat. We depend on other species for food and oxygen e.g, phytoplankton. We need stored grains like rice, wheat, millet. I'm not game to bet on a BOE this year, but I would bet my life savings it will come within 5 years.

Thousands of papers amongst the referee journal literature that explains the reality of the greenhouse effect e.g. 'Nature' or 'Cryosphere' The abundance of greenhouse gas emitted by mankind daily. The planetary heat surplus that can be measured in watts per square metre. The dozens of feedbacks and tipping points. I made an amateur video you can watch that people like. It got reposted on 'Going South' channel. Thousands of views. Most people are unaware of the phenomenon of latent heat and a few other things like CO2 lag time and the abundance of CH4. With an ice free Arctic coming soon, civilization will collapse shortly after. Difficult to say what year, or season, but if you are intellectually honest with yourself, it's easy to see that only a magic wand can maintain 'this set of living arrangements' much further than the early 2020's. The IPCC needs to add up the feedbacks. Water vapour alone will raise average world temperatures by a good 2 degrees before 2030. It's important to mention the bigger picture of ecology. The extinction event already underway. The slight decrease in oxygen. Our demise is not just about CO2, it's overpopulation, pollution in general, loss of topsoil, loss of habitat, overfishing, plastic, toxins etc.	UCjv5F_5TmeMedf7_fkjQ8mA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjv5F_5TmeMedf7_fkjQ8mA	1	UgicDIKdMLvQCHgCoAEC	Roosterdebooster

And 2019 will more than likely be one of the hottest years on record, if not the hottest, above 2016. The IPCC has been terribly conservative. They don't factor in all variables like CH4 and other feedbacks and tipping points as they should. An ice free Arctic Ocean. Reduced albedo from more open ocean, glaciers covered in soot. Moistening of the troposphere. A dip in temperatures in the the near future ?? That's ridiculous. Even if we shut down every power station, temps will still increase.

UgicDIKdMLvQCHgCoAEC.8RTNwHV8AI28pzUKceZbZz		3	2019-01-12 00:59:05	erik newport	Wrong. Earth's been cooling slowly for the last 3,000 years towards the next Ice Age (the last Ice Age ended 10,000 years ago), but this slow cooling trend is made up of a succession of small spikes and dips. The last spike is known as the Medieval Warm Period. The last dip is known as the Little Ice Age. The earth's been warming for 200 years coming out of the Little Ice Age. We are near the top of this spike. We are possibly starting the next dip (hence the lack of warming in recent decades), or possibly have a bit more warming coming before the next dip. Small cycles withing bigger cycles within huge cycles... determined primarily by solar output and changes in the earth's magnetic field (which affects how much of the solar output is absorbed). We should be concerned about going in to the next little ice age or full-blown ice age, as we were in the middle of last century before the collective madness was set in motion. We'll soon be praying for crops to grow as well as they would in the greenhouse earth the IPCC predicted.

If it was, there would be much more peer reviewed journal literature, rather than almost nothing that supports your position David. This idea that scientists thought we were headed toward an ice age, had no consensus. But received alot of media attention, with a front page on the cover of Newsweek. Greenland would have melted considerably around the 1930's because it was relatively hot compared with pre-industrial temps. What you are doing is strenuously looking for anything that supports your presupposition, that climate change is false. Deniers typically have an ideology/worldview/belief system/religion that does not allow the idea that exploitation of the worlds natural resources is bad. The reality is that recent events like Californian bushfires, Hurricanes Florence, Michael, Irma, Harvey, Katrina etc drought in Australia, floods in Asia, famine in Somalia, heat stroke in Pakistan etc is just going to get worse and worse until civilisation collapses within the next 5 years. Maybe geoengineering will save us temporarily, but that won't solve the fundamental problems of overpopulation and the 6th mass extinction that is already underway. We are grinding the living planet into dust.	UCjv5F_5TmeMedf7_fkjQ8mA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjv5F_5TmeMedf7_fkjQ8mA	1	UgicDIKdMLvQCHgCoAEC	Roosterdebooster

We know the blue ocean event is around the corner. The steep decline in ocean sea ice volume is obvious. Self-evident. We are already experiencing consequences of low sea ice with the changes in wind patterns, thawing of permafrost and release of methane, latency, feedbacks. CH4 levels in the atmosphere are already far higher than pre-industrial levels. 'They' are wrong in saying that the Arctic has never been ice-free, BUT that was in geological history.

Currently the planets atmosphere is around 13.5 - 14.0 degrees celcius. Before the industrial revolution the temp was 12 degs. But in the past, average world temperatures have been 22 degs. My point is that it's the RATE of change that is the problem, not just the change itself. Fast rates of change in habitat, are a fantastic way of driving plant and animal species to extinction.

Nobody has ever experienced or can ever experience the earth taken as a whole, so it has to be a dream;t.he problem hat the religion of global warming has is essentially conceptual. You can no more say that the earth has such and such a temperature then you can say that the universe has such and such a temperature.The earth is not a cup of tea. *People believe_in*global warming because – like all religions they WANT to believe such and such for reasons that have nothing whatsoever to do with that which IS and cannot be different, otherwise known as the truth or reality. The better question is to ask why people want to believe this nonsense, and the screamingly obvious reason for that is that human beings tend to be egregious – sheep like and go in for such nonsenses as consensus and or the fallacy that there is a democracy of truth, otherwise known as the fallacy argumentum at populum. Men (human beings) fall into dreaming and fallacies because it is in their nature to dream, and because they don't like feeling isolated (although in fact they are isolated), So They come up, with the fantasy that the call "we".God forbid that I should cognise that I am entirely and absolutely alone.Sheep taken one by one Are timid little creatures and only feel happy in the flock;if their fellow sheep are jumping off cliffs they feel an irresistible urge also to jump off cliffs – not wanting to be the only she doesn't. If you want to understand the psychology of the religion of global warming or religion generally you need to understand the psychology of sheep, And recognise that men are not men but sheep– Not a very pleasant understanding to which to come.It is not natural form into wish to be individuals, and I'm not altogether convinced that it is even possible for them to be individuals,Particularly since it is their custom or habit to program hypnotise, or condition their results (children) into being sheep by means of that process that they have invented that they call education.

The Earth can change nothing, it's a ball of rock with a molten iron core. The thin layer of organic matter, called the ecosystem, and an even thinner layer of gases is all that stands between us and space. The ecosystem under normal conditions creates a stable environment for all species, we have exploded in numbers and are now double what we were sisty years ago, we are greedy apes who want everything and are spoiling it all for greedm and filling the oceans with pastic. There are now plastic islands [made from fossil fuel] that don't decay and are now found in all lifegorms including humans. Human hearts have been found to contain microplastics.

Not too long ago we were told to fear the evils of man-made global warming. But there has been no increase in the average global temperature since 1998. So in order not to appear foolish, the name Global Warming was changed and now it’s Climate Change. Today we are told that practically any extreme climate event that occurs happens because humans and man-made carbon dioxide caused it. “Climate is changing, and climate has always changed. The hoax is that there are some people who are so arrogant to think that they are so powerful they can change climate. Man can’t change climate.” - James Inhofe U.S. Senate’s chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Dr. Don Easterbrook (in his presentation of 2013), Professor Emeritus of Geology at Western Washington University, exposes how the data has been tampered with (by NASA, NOAA and the National Science Foundation). He points out that: – all high temperature records were set in 1930s before the rise of CO2; – global cooling has been in effect since 1998, according to ground and satellite measurements; – both the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets are growing; – CO2 is incapable of causing global warming (given that it constitutes 38/1000th of 1 percent of atmospheric gases); – there is no correlation between CO2 and temperature; – CO2 follows temperature rather than preceding or causing it; – the sea level is rising (Seattle in specific) and falling (US Pacific Northwest in general) depending on where you are, and that the sea is rising at a very slow and constant rate; – extreme weather (such as hurricanes) has not increased; – snowfall has increased across the US; and – that the oceans are still very alkaline (pH 8.2) not acidic. Maurice Newman chairman of former Australian PM Tony Abbott’s business advisory council, stated that “The real agenda is concentrated political authority. Global warming is the hook [to create] a New World Order.” AGW is about controlling you, not the climate. Climate has been the master excuse for decades now, ever since the idea was hatched and exposed in documents like Report from Iron Mountain in 1966, The Club of Rome’s The First Global Revolution? in 1991, and by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers at the 4th World Wilderness Congress in 1987. Professor Ivar Giaever, the 1973 Nobel Prizewinner for Physics, talks about how manmade global warming has become the new religion which cannot be challenged. He likens CO2 fearmongering to the story of the Emperor’s new clothes. The purported 97% consensus and the hockey stick graphs are both utterly fake. He states that: “Global Warming is pseudoscience … from 1880 to 2013 the temperature has increased from ~288K to 288.8K (0.3%) … the temperature has been amazingly stable. Is it possible that all the paved roads and cut down forests are the cause of “global warming”, not the CO2? CO2 is not pollution.” “The facts, such as we can observe and calculate them, do not support the idea of man-made global warming. Natural processes completely eclipse anything that man can accomplish.” - William Hunt, research scientist National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration	UCGxRky9heAI6qoEDYmuBJZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGxRky9heAI6qoEDYmuBJZA	1	Ugi28XgdMg7ZaXgCoAEC	Mark Chippendale

UggxSIreaqPavngCoAEC	13	3	2016-11-23 08:22:37	Davin Chase	Yes, Climate change has been going on for as long as there is a climate BUT and this is a big but, rarely ever this fast. It&#39;s the rate of change that life-systems, as in all living things, can&#39;t evolve fast enough to adapt to. But when it has changed rapidly it has led to mass extinctions including as recently discovered, forms of humans and took millions of years to recover from. Daily we lose species. It&#39;s not a conspiracy. It&#39;s ecological fact! Another thing the great egotistical and wordy &quot;Lord Monckton&quot; probably knows nothing at all about is a phenomenon called &quot;Global Dimming&quot;. (Global dimming is defined as the decrease in the amounts of solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth. The by-product of fossil fuels are tiny particles or pollutants which absorb solar energy and reflect back sunlight into the space). You see fossil fuels around the world create a temporary dimming effect kind of like sunglasses that actually TEMPORARILY shield the earth and therefor lower the apparent temperature. So the reality is the world is ALLOT hotter than we even think it is. But the great Lord Moncton doesn&#39;t know all this because he isn&#39;t a scientist. Is he? No so what would he know about climate change, the environment. I&#39;d believe the experts of this guy any day. You may step down now your lordship.

He points out that: – all high temperature records were set in 1930s before the rise of CO2; – global cooling has been in effect since 1998, according to ground and satellite measurements; – both the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets are growing; – CO2 is incapable of causing global warming (given that it constitutes 38/1000th of 1 percent of atmospheric gases); – there is no correlation between CO2 and temperature; – CO2 follows temperature rather than preceding or causing it; – the sea level is rising (Seattle in specific) and falling (US Pacific Northwest in general) depending on where you are, and that the sea is rising at a very slow and constant rate; – extreme weather (such as hurricanes) has not increased; – snowfall has increased across the US; and – that the oceans are still very alkaline (pH 8.2) not acidic. Maurice Newman chairman of former Australian PM Tony Abbott’s business advisory council, stated that “The real agenda is concentrated political authority. Global warming is the hook [to create] a New World Order.” AGW is about controlling you, not the climate. Climate has been the master excuse for decades now, ever since the idea was hatched and exposed in documents like Report from Iron Mountain in 1966, The Club of Rome’s The First Global Revolution? in 1991, and by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers at the 4th World Wilderness Congress in 1987. Professor Ivar Giaever, the 1973 Nobel Prizewinner for Physics, talks about how manmade global warming has become the new religion which cannot be challenged. He likens CO2 fearmongering to the story of the Emperor’s new clothes. The purported 97% consensus and the hockey stick graphs are both utterly fake. He states that: “Global Warming is pseudoscience … from 1880 to 2013 the temperature has increased from ~288K to 288.8K (0.3%) … the temperature has been amazingly stable. Is it possible that all the paved roads and cut down forests are the cause of “global warming”, not the CO2? CO2 is not pollution.” “The facts, such as we can observe and calculate them, do not support the idea of man-made global warming. Natural processes completely eclipse anything that man can accomplish.” - William Hunt, research scientist National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration	UCGxRky9heAI6qoEDYmuBJZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGxRky9heAI6qoEDYmuBJZA	1	UggxSIreaqPavngCoAEC	Davin Chase

This is a technology issue and developing nations really can just leapfrog right over the shitty inefficient stages that we went through. Oh and yes, the government really does create technology, unlike yourself. And the carbon tax is a conservative magical fix to the issue, built to allow cronies to sell indulgences. We can just objectively appraise what companies actually have more efficient options in front of them and fine them for dragging their feet on implementing them through the epa.

See this one first, and feel convinced that Monckton has showed climate change to be a hoax. He does a pretty good job of appearing sincere, honest, serious, intelligent and credible. <br /><br />But as Potholer54 demonstrates beyond all reasonable doubt in his video series dealing with Monckton, the very studies cited by Monckton very often show the exact opposite of what Monckton uses them to support. Or they are not peer-reviewed. Or they aren&#39;t studies at all, but mere opinion pieces. What&#39;s more, Monckton often continues to use them in the same way after he has been shown to be in error. The same goes for distorted quotes and cherry-picked data. <br /><br />Please be open-minded enough to watch both this video and the Potholer54 ones before you draw any conclusions. I can promise you that Potholer54&#39;s videos are easy to check, as he provides very complete source information for all the relevant claims. And you will come to view this snake oil salesman for what he really is. The experience of first watching him and finding him very convincing, and then seeing his arguments thoroughly and undeniably dismantled is an uncomfortable one. But it is a very useful exercise. I myself have become far more able to resist the kinds of techniques Monckton employs, and am now better able to check claims made rather than have to rely on whether or not someone seems knowledgable, honest and so on.

Studies that confirm the pre-existing consensus? Of course not! It's the new discoveries that really change our understanding and often overturn the status quo (in a restricted sense, as with relativity fundamentally changing how we think of space and time, but Newtonian mechanics remains just as useful and accurate as it ever was). That's why I point out that anyone who has good evidence contradicting the consensus in climate science would have a great shot at the Nobel prize. Finally, even though I'm sure your very strong feelings about the issue are genuine, how intensely you feel says nothing about whether you're right. And, btw, calling me an ape doesn't insult me, like you seem to imagine it would. You see, I'm sufficiently scientifically literate to know that humans are indeed apes. Even if some of us at times seem to imply a more lowly - perhaps reptilian? - ancestry.

I have found the "global warming" craze to be another way the globalists are manipulating the world to let them control the population; and since so many have seen through it, they have had to change the language to "climate change"--seemingly more plausible, but certainly farther away from the idea that it's caused by man-made things. Having said that, I certainly do not advocate continuing to pollute the world with garbage, plastic, etc, and I'm a good recycler, etc.	UCrkNzkSiXqeqMvYbmw-MX4A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrkNzkSiXqeqMvYbmw-MX4A	1	Ugj2Wr68wx46engCoAEC	dojohansen123

We know this because it was lifted word for word from the study. But they were selective in what they told you. The 2nd part of the same paragraph states that the Arctic ice is decreasing at a much faster rate then the Antarctic is gaining. (At least 5 times from memory). The fact that deniers that produce these blogs (they seem lacking in peer reviewed scientific research on the subject), must have read the results for the Arctic, but chose to omit it, should tell you all you need to know about their agenda.

Something he has claimed on so many ocassions that: (From Wikipedia:) In July 2011 the House of Lords took the &quot;unprecedented step&quot; of publishing online a cease and desist letter to Monckton from the Clerk of the Parliaments, which concluded, &quot;I am publishing this letter on the parliamentary website so that anybody who wishes to check whether you are a Member of the House of Lords can view this official confirmation that you are not.&quot; (Check the site yourself). <br /><br />So before you &quot;believe&quot; every word this speaker says; he&#39;s his rap sheet: <a href="https://bbickmore.wordpress.com/lord-moncktons-rap-sheet/">https://bbickmore.wordpress.com/lord-moncktons-rap-sheet/</a> That&#39;s right; if you have Graves’ Disease, AIDS, Multiple Schlerosis, the flu, and the common cold, HE HAS A CURE.

None. What there is, is a plan and a scheme drawn up by The Club Of Rome using global warming/climate change, as a means to achieve their goals. Agenda 21, 2030 agenda, et al. Funny how Man isn't being blamed for the magnetic pole shift now occurring. Or for the weakening of the earth's magnetic field. But Man is being blamed for the climate change, and sha-ZAAAAM, the solution is a complete overhaul of what life looks like on earth, for the Common man. Funny, they tell us that aircraft travel is the number ONE contributor to global warming, yet NO steps are taken to even sow that in the slightest. Too Big to Fail, I suppose. I suspect you are a shill, so I don't expect much out of you in the way of genuine thought. My words are for you, but put out there in the hopes that actual thinking individuals will read them.

So YOU supplied me with the WONG address. Gee thanks a bunch. You write: "Right on the first page is ken adachi's name and contact info, and you'll find lots of good articles by himself and others" So who is Ken Adachi? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Adachi Died in 1989. http://barbarahartwellvscia.blogspot.co.id/2012/11/educate-yourself-about-ken-adachi.html I love this one: http://americanloons.blogspot.co.id/2013/02/432-ken-adachi.html educate-yourself.org is a site NOT worth reading. You write: "I gave you a non-christian source cuz you are probably unaware of the good, thorough, truthful researchers such as doug hagmann, steve quayle, johnny cirucci, and many others I have read." What is your obsession with sources being "christian"? Do you think that makes them more truthful or reliable? If you do you really should study up on the behaviour of the established churches over the centuries and the various evangelical churches with their "Reverands" who live like KINGS while their followers starve. Anyone can call themself a "christian"; and these days in the USA it's the best disguise you can wear. You write: "Their research" How do you know that they have done ANY "research" at all? Because they have a blog site? You write: "is not aimed to promote religion and in fact repudiates it," So doug hagmann, steve quayle, johnny cirucci, and many others don't promote religion; they epudiate it; which has got WHAT to do with "Lord" Christopher Monckton and global warming????????????? You write: "but rather is meant to expose false religion and other false and dangerous movements in society." Why do you keep going on about religion? You write: "another nonchristian, popular source is David Icke, but I have tended to steer away from him as a christian". OK, we get the point. You're a "christian"; whatever that is. Yes, I said "whatever that is". And I said that because the number of different groups with totally different beliefs who all claim to be "christian" is overwhelming. And the number of "christians" out there who hate each other because of that makes the whole belief system a joke. You write: "The globalists, nwo leaders, illuminatists, cabalists have been working on infiltrating and changing society for many, many years; they started in the u.s. in the early 1900's. It's only a matter of where their progress currently is." There is NO illuminati. The Jewish people do not run the world; nor do they control the worlds money supply. Stop believing the bullshit other people tell you. You can't prove any of it because it's NOT happening. It's all myths. The only people YOU should be worried about right NOW are Trumps cabinet. Because they are going to FUCK OVER AMERICA; and the rest of the world is going to have to live with the pain. You write: "They would want to control every thought and word that every person has." Have you read 1984? You write: "They would tax the air you breathe as well as any rain that you might collect in your own yard." They can impose an "air tax"; it's easy; getting people to pay it; that's the problem. And an AMERICAN company that BOUGHT the water supply infrastructure in a South American country had the government of the country make it ILLEGAL to collect rain water; because it ate into their profits. (That started a  revolution in the country). So that can be done as well. You write: "Don't worry, my computer is fine, and I do and have read many classics. I am also choosing to avail myself of the warnings that are all around us that we need to be fighting for our freedom; if not, it will be taken from us." If you believe that; then you should be in local politics. Start at the base and work up. Right now the USA is a worldwide joke because it's people are dumber then bricks; they believe anything they are told; and they have elected are BROKE sorry arse joke for president.

They would tax the air you breathe as well as any rain that you might collect in your own yard. Don't worry, my computer is fine, and I do and have read many classics. I am also choosing to avail myself of the warnings that are all around us that we need to be fighting for our freedom; if not, it will be taken from us.

Yeah, that pretty much is happening now. Is there anything you don't pay a tax on? You write: 'They need to provide justification for taking complete control over all the world's normally free resources," Did you just say "free resources"? What "free resources" specifically? You write: "which is how they would then control the whole population." Which parts of the world population aren't currently being controlled? You write: "Don't just study soros; study the illuminati," I've never studied George Soros. And there is NO "illuminati". You write: "the new world order leaders, the globalists, the jesuits, etc. etc. etc." They are taking their time aren't they? I first heard every word you about 40 years ago. You write: "If you need a non-christian source, go to educateyourself.org". Yes, because "christian" sources are just SO "honest" and "reliable". It's not like religion isn't just another scam to make money and abuse children. TELL ME; who ownsd and runs "http://ww38.educateyourself.org/". You know; if I wanted to ask them some questions about the "information" on the site? Apart from the site being complete and utter BULLSHIT with absolutely no contact information; (which is an obvious sign that the place is one giant scam); when you click on "illuminati and new world order" link it takes to to a RELIGIOUS link and one for "Illuminati Secrets Exposed"; which is yet ANOTHER page with NO contact information on it. (See above for clues on scam sites). If I was you I'd clear all my cookies and run a complete and total security scan of you computer. Then go down to your local library and take out a book, a classic, and read it. And stop wasting your time with all this nonsense.

UghQa_fiDIBILHgCoAEC	0	0	2016-06-26 18:28:39	grindupBaker	I propose that El Nino trend started pulling away from La Nina trend ~1990 at La Nina = 0.16 / decade, El Nino = 0.20 / decade based on (1) I made a graph 2+ years ago when sks guy suggested chopping El Ninos from the trend to show it cleanly without the &quot;pause&quot; caused by 1997/8 El Nino. I went further and found the significant trend difference. (2) Later I saw info that Pacific Easterlies are strengthening since 1990 and are now 1 m/s faster than they used to be (apparently unusual, not doing that before). This skims more warm water west into the huge warm pool from Australia north (that&#39;s what the &quot;pauses&quot; are) (3) A scientist talk I heard recently said paleoclimate showed clearly a more &quot;La Nina like&quot; situation when GMST is higher (leading to more of the flattish GMST trends punctuated by ever-larger El Ninos) (4) It&#39;s my understanding that the 1997/8 and 2015/16 El Ninos are unusually large in the full record (5) I heard tentatively that a warmer Atlantic tropical surface boosts the Pacific Easterlies. If correct, this ties it all together with an explanation and is really fascinating. There must be a +ve feedback for ENSO in both directions. It&#39;s the &quot;both directions&quot; that&#39;s fascinating. With no +ve feedback there would be no ENSO, the wind would just push surface water west to some point where it would stay in dynamic balance shifting back &amp; forth a bit, no ENSO. Suppose Pacific Easterlies strengthen if Atlantic tropical surface warms vis-à-vis Pacific tropical surface. There&#39;s some easterly blowing, it skims surface water west, this reveals colder water at surface, this drops Pacific surface temp vis-à-vis Atlantic, this strengthens wind, pushes more water, and so on, it&#39;s a +ve feedback that shoves warm surface water west to the huge area from Australia up almost to Japan. At some point this spring is coiled so tight with extremely warm water piled up 8&quot; high north of Australia that the push back matches the strong east wind. Then something pulls the trigger (I have a recollection of some event from Indian Ocean doing it, and of the Indonesia current switching directions). Some warm surface water moves east against the wind, which raises Pacific surface temp vis-à-vis Atlantic, this weakens the east wind, so more water sloshes back east, and so on, it&#39;s a +ve feedback in the easterly direction this time. If this should be correct about the mechanism then it gets interesting. &quot;Global warming&quot; warms both Atlantic &amp; Pacific tropical surface so there would be no relative change and no effect on Pacific easterlies from the calm situation. However, the well-mixed layer nominally 90m deep below the Pacific surface cannot warm as much as the surface for a couple of hundred years so when the Pacific easterly wind skims the surface then the water revealed below is more colder than the surface than it was before, so the wind gets stronger with this hypothesis because the Pacific surface revealed by skimming is more colder than the warmed Atlantic surface than before. <br /><br />Conclusion: Commencing ~1990 it pushes longer and harder because warmer Atlantic surface, causes more warm water to pile up above Australia (and likely warms it more), drives more heat into the deep ocean from evaporation and mechanical (8&quot; more water pressure west than east), when the trigger is pulled there&#39;s a stronger El Nino 1997/8 &amp; 2015/6 (pulling away at 0.20, maybe higher now, vs 0.16), causes longer &quot;pauses&quot; with lots of La Ninas until the trigger is pulled. Will continue warming in an increasingly stepwise fashion like this (massive El Ninos) but then reducing El Ninos back like before as the well-mixed ocean layer gets to warm similar to surface, back to prior El Nino size (with warmer La Nina years) as the ocean temperature balances. The next big El Nino ~2033 is going to be quite spectacular in terms of heat released and the following La Nina will bring some spectacular rain storms in some regions, nothing seen by humans since the Eemian Optimum 133,000 years ago. Fascinating.	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	0

The main problem is that we will not see effect of this massive CO2 production for a year or more. No one can predict the critical point of amount of CO2 and time when all will be under water. A lot of times a greed stricken companies hire a scientists too talk about “Global warming HOAX” and pay them 1000’s of $ to convince the rest of us.

I have something similar foe you: If we pump the CO2 into the box with human being inside, guess how long this human going to last ? The fact remains, we all leave in a “box” called planet Earth. We all living things need clean air and clean environment for our development. Humans with their activity and greed destroying nature balance in catastrophic speed. I can not predict how much time we have left, but we are approaching critical point very fast. I am sure, that average person without special education can understand our situation. I am sure you remember a “little shake” we had at Indian Ocean and how many vanished, and this is without raised water level.

Anyway i already knew he's not an accredited scientist of any sort, since he makes that clear while clarifying his arguments, but he's a very good advocate, admirably so, which is what i like about him. Stick him in a room with Bill Nye to debate, and Bill Nye would probably be killed. But Bill was already murdered by that other climatologist guy i can't remember the name of with the wacky hair and glasses. Really were there an argument to ignite here, we'd be speaking for two different topics entirely. I however have decided my allegiance on the global warming issue.

"Warming" and heat does not cause living creatures on earth to bleach, that only comes from lack of sunlight (i.e. caucasians, polar bears or the crabs and worms that are found at the bottom of the oceans. Possibly the reef isnt getting enough proper sunlight due to chemtrails and pollution. Also the earth rotates everything...death some places- new life somewhere else... http://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-reef-discovered-off-australia-s-southern-coast-rivals-the-great-barrier-reef . Saying anything is the "most of all time", only means since we've been recording these events - mere decades - not all time. As for all those extinct animals, most are caused by humans poaching and geoengineering cross breeds for science. The Earth does its thing and creates and evolves just as many new species all the time... http://news.discovery.com/animals/new-tree-of-life-created-1000-species-added-16041.htm .

UghL0hCsxugjeXgCoAEC	0	2	2016-04-17 18:57:47	lmwrt	Hello to all. I&#39;m Portuguese and this is another great talk by Lord Monckton. And like him, I do believe that the UE is a tyrant and like him I say  ´´j&#39;accuse´´ the EU.  People just don´t know where they jumped into. It doesn´t take a rocket scientist to see and feel that him and all true scientists are absolutely right. First of all, CO2 is not a pollutant, it is breading gas exhaled by all animals and breading inhaled gas by all plants. Plants thrive on CO2 and give humans more Oxygen (O2). But I like conspiracy theories and this agenda, telling us that CO2 is pollution, may very whell be intended to decrease CO2 to kill plants, as studies show that plants start to die at about 160 ppm CO2, if I&#39;m not mistaken. And by killing or stopping plants to thrive, then their agenda for depopulation is achieved by starving millions. Remember that cereals are plants that need the CO2.The other way to kill humans by the millions would be exactely telling that there is a climate warming, leading people to believe them without a doubt. And then in the next 20 or 30 years if the Sun gets cold as predicted by many scientist, and we are in that small ice age like in the 1800&#39;s, people will not have take any cautions to survive in the cold and their intentions will then be achieved. In my point of view, they are using the two plans at the same time, plan A and plan B. This is a sad and sick agenda. I just hope that people in the right places open their eyes and can indeed stop these criminal minds behind this premeditated holocaust. May God, Gaia, Jesus, Buddha, The Universe, or whatever you wish to call it, bless us all and give us the wisdom to deal with this.

Post WW2 heating is also our responsibility. We are now a force of nature. We alter both the atmospheric chemistry and the ocean's chemistry.

Industrialization went ballistic, too. More particulates and SO2, along with the CO2. After the war the world needed to rebuild and recontour the economy for consumer products. This also added to the "aerosol parasol" effect which cooled the surface for 30 years. The clean air act was passed in the early 70s making for cleaner air, but also allowing the entrapment of more heat from the vastly increased CO2 production without the full protection of the aerosols. @Story Gordon	UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	1	UgiOze4YD-oBTXgCoAEC	George Jones

The increased retention of heat by CO2 is therefore inarguable. Yes, climate changes. But the operative situation here is the SPEED with which the change is occurring. There is no "natural" precedent for it. Then there is the fact that CO2 has been the driving force in most of the heating events we know about, going back over millions of years. CO2 in the atmosphere, regardless of source, has always been in the driver's seat.

For immigration, I like what u say about other stuff then a wall. Totally get that. I just seen 10 mins ago. Trudeau just threw 114 mill at illegals coming into the country. To house them and take care of them. Whatever. Also he slams the door on people who are trying to get into our awesome country the right way. I'm all for legal immigration but if people can't come in the right way they should stay out. Tons of people are coming in through Quebec from NY state. Also if people can't integrate into the way we live here they shouldn't been here, period. Not sure if u noticed but he isn't stopping bad people. We shouldn't be paying for these people if they can't come in the right way. Why isn't Alberta booming with all the oil availible there? We should be using our own oil and not importing it all. U have to look into why we arnt doing anything with Alberta. It should blow ur mind.

Add up how much that costs you per year, you would be blown away. I try and remind myself to drive smart. I l look a block ahead at the light and can usually tell if its going to be red or green when I get there and accelerate or brake accordingly. Its amazing how much longer my tank lasts. I blow 3 bucks every morning at Starbucks. We are such a wasteful society, any single one of these things in itself will offset the carbon tax the average person pays. Without a thinking society cheap fuel just enable waste, unfortunately. When gas get really cheap what do people do? Put that extra money in the bank? No, studies actually found a sharp increase in the purchase of large gas guzzling SUV's during times of historically low fuel prices. When consumers stay away from the most fuel-efficient vehicles there is a lack of innovation and investment in new vehicle technology and design. If we keep showing that we’re mice willing to take the bait of big dumb vehicles and temporarily low gas prices, then automakers have no incentive to produce more efficient vehicles. As for my opinion on immigration, I feel Canada needs more people. We sell our resources for pennies on the dollar, only to buy them back in the form of products. More people means we could manufacture more of our resources here. We just have to let the right people in. Our border is way too long to physically enforce, and besides, based on the Trump administrations design, each mile of physical border wall would cost $24.5 million. On the other hand a 'smart wall' utilizing off-the-shelf proven tracking technology, thermal imaging that can tell a human from a deer, and state-of-the-art drones, the cost-per-mile comes down to less than $500,000, thats like 2% of a physical wall, and it could be fully operational within a year. I would way rather spend money on this, and more long term border security jobs than concrete. Put the money into increasingly cheap technology and jobs for people. Like they say, for every 20 ft wall theres a 25 ft ladder! Its also good to keep in mind in the case of the US that the US has endorsed torture and murder, regime change and corruption, and tried to destabilize the very countries these people are coming from, so they shouldn't act so shocked at whats happening. Interesting times we live in thats for sure!	UCcaBPC-p5nnDVcwRWo92gOw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcaBPC-p5nnDVcwRWo92gOw	1	UggyXo4U7sxO0XgCoAEC	TheShockmister

Some people say it will be better and some say it's a money grab. Now, me being from canada (not sure where u are from) being taxed more is not the solution. Us canadians are taxed enough. The avg canadian making say 85000/year is paying over 30k in taxes. Almost half the money we work hard for is gone to the government. This carbon tax is going to take more money from us. I'd say France has had enough of being over taxed by the look of that country now. Australia tried implementing a carbon tax and people of Australia said no. Also, getting off topic. Canada's immigration laws are brutal. This open border bs has got to stop. Look at Europe. Can I get ur thoughts on that.

But check out some articles on new solid state battery technology. Teslas get 400km or something already even without this new battery tech. Plants do consume Co2 but too much and they will die, just like humans need oxygen or water to survive but too much will kill us. As for discussing this topic, or any topic of importance, I always find its best not to get angry with people. My intention is not to win, but discuss. Cheers for mentioning that. I think when we really break it down most of us want the same thing in life, to be able to provide for our families and raise them in a safe environment with clean air and water. We just have to find that balance. And in my mind its one in the same, a healthy planet with healthy citizens is essential for a healthy economy to exist.

(Could be wrong) if people knew about electric cars back then why havnt we got rid of gas vehicles by now? Technology is not good enough yet to make electric cars the norm? Also, why do banks still give loans out for people/business building on the coasts. Also insurance. Also, don't plants and trees love to absorb Co2 for growth? There is just alot of questions/doubt for alot of people and this climate change thing. I love our discussion by the way. No name calling like most arguments lol.

The carbon tax is to encourage people to use less gas. The more efficient vehicle you drive, the less tax you pay. if you drive an electric car you pay no carbon tax at all. In the carbon neutral world they are proposing there will be actually be no money for them to grab, so I don't really agree. Even if we kept coal and fossil fuel power plants but took gas vehicles off the road and switched them to electric it would make a huge change. One large fossil fuel powered plant feeding electric vehicles will produce a fraction of the CO2 that thousands of small gas engines driving around would. Will it save the planet? I don't know, global warming is like a wrecking ball, we can try and stop the chain but the ball is still going to keep moving forward from past momentum. People can argue all they want about who made the ball, but its still a wrecking ball, you need to get out of the way or stop it. As we are not yet an interplanetary species, we don't really have any where to get out of the way to, so we have to try and stop it. Global warming aside, we only have 53 yrs left of proven oil reserves anyways, burning it is the absolute worst use of this resource. We make computers, car parts, asphalt for the roads they drive on, clothing, plastic, literally thousands of things from it, to the point its hard to imagine how modern civilization would cope if all these products we no longer available. I don't know what will happen when we run out, yet its only a generation away. I say use it for its most practical purpose. This combined with pollution, climate change, the mass introduction of solar and wind farms and the near horizon of limitless, emission free fusion make it a no brainer to me.

Global temperatures are rising while the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth is actually in a period of decline. As well, the upper atmosphere is cooling while the lower atmosphere warms, a clear fingerprint of warming from greenhouse gases, rather than 'that bright thing in the sky'. The Earth is warming, the sun is in a cool phase, our atmosphere has very high levels of heat trapping CO2, and we have 7.5 billion humans emitting that gas.

The earth is 4.5 billion years old, you cant even grasp how minute the changes have been up until the last century. Even still it eventually swings between hot and cold. You're say that in your particular part of the world, in your short lifetime, that because you don't see water levels rising from pictures of a rock that climate change isnt happening? Man, thats some dope science there bud! Take your little rock science project behind the barn and shoot it. Sea level rise doesnt even happen at the same rate everywhere in the world anyways, so its meaningless. How about the smoke from forest fires that fill the streets of Vancouver every summer? That never used to happen the way it is now. Pine beetle not dying in the warmer winters, more lightning strikes, drier soil, all components of a warming planet. Sure as fuck the climate is changing. Ive worked in the forest for 30 years.	UCcaBPC-p5nnDVcwRWo92gOw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcaBPC-p5nnDVcwRWo92gOw	1	UggyXo4U7sxO0XgCoAEC	TheShockmister

Since then, scientists have further refined their understanding of the greenhouse effect and the role our rising carbon emissions are having on it. From the first Earth Day in 1970, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen 24 percent. And because carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, the impacts of our emissions today will linger long into the future. Chief among the impacts is the rise in the global temperature. That’s why countries around the world have agreed to limitthat warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures.

This causes a horizontal pressure gradient in the ocean deep water which causes a movement southward of the deep water (an ocean current). That portion of the North Atlantic circulation is necessary to keep the circle going in which wind drives a film of warm surface water northest from the tropics to warm Europe so that it has a warmer climate than Labrador in Canada.

In 2006 he referred to himself as &quot;a member of the Upper House of the United Kingdom legislature&quot; in a letter to US Senators,[48] and has said he was &quot;a member of the Upper House but without the right to sit or vote.&quot;[49] The House of Lords authorities have said Monckton is not and never has been a member and that there is no such thing as a non-voting or honorary member of the House.[6][34]<br /><br />In July 2011 the House of Lords took the &quot;unprecedented step&quot; of publishing online a cease and desist letter to Monckton from the Clerk of the Parliaments, which concluded, &quot;I am publishing this letter on the parliamentary website so that anybody who wishes to check whether you are a Member of the House of Lords can view this official confirmation that you are not.&quot;[25][26]	UCo4bYbW7Ty6hDA0jjG1KEBQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo4bYbW7Ty6hDA0jjG1KEBQ	0

Before humans started chopping down the forests and burning fossil fuels the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was at 280 parts per million. Now it is at 409 parts per million (where it is climbing at 3 parts per million per year thanks to emissions). It was otherwise stable at 280 parts per million for 10,000 years. If we get to 1000 parts per million, then you wont be able to open your window anymore to get fresh air, because 1000 parts per million is the threshold where humans can detect that the room is too stuffy. Give that some thought. And if you don't believe me do a Google search for "nasa CO2" and you will see the graphs that show that the CO2 concentrations really are growing that fast and if you google "CO2 stuffy room threshold" and you click on the first link you find, you will see that 1000 parts per million of CO2 to 2000 parts per million of CO2 are concentrations that cause complaints of drowsiness and poor air. Forget global Warming if you don't believe in it. WE ARE RUINING OUR AIR!!! I gave good evidence and I made it easy for you to follow up on it. Please reconsider your policies.

As for science, there are about 10,000 climate scientists in 180 nations who know that global warming is an empirical fact, with 97 agreeing the evidence shows human activity as the cause and the other 3% requesting more research. There is no evidence against global warming or any other logical explanation than human activity, according to the world's climate scientists.

I don't know if you had an existing quarrel with this bloke, but even if you have good reason to believe this is someone who (like Monckton himself) knows better and just goes on lying anyway, that context is missing here. Any reasonable person who sees it, especially if they aren't convinced GW is real and serious, will just become further antagonized. In these times of ever more dysfunctional public debate it is more important than ever to make the effort to stay calm, stick to the issue, and be reasonable.

Forcing the people with taxation to reduce gas emission is a bad idea. Italy for example has achieved the targets for co2 emission reduction, only because taxes have ended many businesses. Clime change strategy is used as a tool to centralize power to eliminate democracy in the world. If the people do not have enough money to convert from fossil to clean energy a war against the minority self legalized elite could be inevitable and necessary. In the mean time the best thing to do is to inform the people the best we can, to save more lives as possible, winning democracies back avoiding silly wars or revolutions.

I know a lot about ENSO El Nino , also about La Nina.  What your trying to make-up by the El Nino is a lot of false facts, you do not understand ENSO like you did prove by your statements like: "course they proclaim that El Nino is "amplified" by the alleged man made global warming" What is not made-up it is measured and observed ... http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/16/2007/2016/ https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/new-el-niño-coming-strong Then further you did claim that the global temp is not rising anthropogenic and there will be a global temp falling coming up. This is weird because no one in science of research would make such statements, because they are very unrealistic and we can say wrong. Of course the global Temp will fall a bit, but you can not call this cooling this is too weird: There is also a heat record coming up for a La Nina Year, like it was the years 2007 and 2010 and now it is expected to become a very hot La Nina year and NOT in this sense "cooling", that would be great if there would be a global temps drop of over 1 C degree next year we could call "cooling", but this will not happen, even if La Nina would be the strongest ever - it will of course not happen and not drop the global temp by -1 C degree not even near -1C degree, the best expected would be between -0.05 and -0.1 C Degree and this is much too hot of course for a La Nina year still over +1 C degree and will very likely break a record for an La Nina year. We will see next year, but your statements are not realistic at all for the future, even not when we add the Great Sunspot Minimum to your weird theory. http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.pdf 	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

Sea Level rise does cause the following devastating impacts which are much more relevant of course.... 1. Sea Level Rise adds a lot of fresh water to the Oceans, what is very devastating, related to marine life, Ocean warming, Saltification Ocean Water, Ocean Streams -> Global weather and Climate Zones and the tipping point of the climate system ...  it is very simple to understand. 2. Sea Level Rise will have a great impact on the global economy and will collapse the economy of every country very fast, because it has devastating impacts on ... Shipping, ports and infrastructure in the harbors of every metropolitan and city on the sea and every major port of the world, also on Ship trips and locks, canals. Also on some great Air Ports build near the sea.   Which will all lead to an economic decline and stifle of global trade and devastating impacts on the economy of every global trading nation. Also when there would be enough time to rebuild all this infrastructure and secure the infrastructure, it will cost so much money in a short time and be only a help for a while, it will have devastating impacts on the world wide economy to make these investments and takes a long time to do so and still have devastating impacts on more appearing and more intense extreme weather events still pushing the sea level rise into the land and infrastructures.   3. Also will have like it has already today on some nations like Bangladesh, impacts on agriculture / food, because Sea - Level- Rise will have impacts with salty water on ground water and agriculture near the cost lines and will push salty water and floods in to regions where you can not and will not grow food anymore.       	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

Deniers pretend to hope there is a debate when the science was "incontrovertible" before 1979. Those deniers are dead meat now. The arctic ice record is showing temperature 36 degrees F above normal now. The changes foretold over 35 years ago can now be seen in real time. We are there. We are in an abrupt change. The science now shows climate regimes change in 2 or 3 years. Now, Guy McPherson's estimate of human extinction by 2030, look to be very correct. We don't really care about the planet at this point. All we care about is keeping the civilization we have known all our lives. Let's all hope the financial markets keep working. Let's all hope we can keep the pollution in the air. Let's all hope the just in time delivery by trucks, & maintenance of 440 nuclear power stations can keep going. It don't matter now if 6 billion die between now and 2030 or 2040 or 2060,.it is going to be a steep decline At the rate of change now, it will not take long for people to wake up.

Now they pretend the global warming is on the rise again, because of the El Nino period; but the fact is, this is a totally natural phenomenon and therefore something they _used to ignore_ to incorporate in the models during previous periods. When this El Nino period end this year, we going to see a long and steady decline in the global temperature -- and the warmists going to be hysterical because even they see that the Earth is _not_ going under.

This is no claim, there are facts about the 2015 EL Nino, measured not only in Record Temps also the EL Nino by itself was record to be the one of the strongest we know so far and it is no wounder, because it gets drive by more heat energy of the Oceans and Atmosphere by global warming, what is simple education of how ENSO works to fuel El Nino. This is very simple education. What you are claim is just very wrong and not scientific at all, I do not know where you got this gossip from, but it is very sure not from research and not from a scientific source. 2. What should I google?  There is in the last decades not one little or single event, which is connected with the sun and would have lead to more warming, not one single ! More the contrary that the sun did cool or was in normal state. I never heard of a scientific paper that claims the sun would be the cause of global warming, never and I did read a lot of research about the sun and also the sun cycles. I also never heard that the IPCC has information that the sun would heat up earth or would play an relevant role for warming in the last decades, this is just false fact and the IPCC is not doing research they are just informing, estimating, simulating and monitoring for politics.    3."this global warming hysteria is destined to go down in history as pseudoscience like all other "scientific" scares and alarmisms:" You are very uneducated, I can tell you not enough, you are fooling yourself with such false facts. The anthropogenic climate change is the cause of too much mankind emission warming-up earth, specially very relevant and very devastating are the high CO2 Emissions, mostly caused by wrong energy solutions and fossil fuels, 2nd by transport and 3rd by other productions and consume of mankind. And this problem is very serious and it is very clear that it will push very clear Mass-Extinction, even the last few years this is very clear to see on marine life and today it does start to get more serious on species and vegetation on land, on food and freshwater. This all is very well known and not to hide, it is fact people do face daily and what you say that everything would be OK is non-sense and surreal. I think everyone knows all the devastating impacts of global warming last years and decades and how rapid worse it does get, also all the positive feedbacks in the climate system which are very devastating and impossible to fix, not getting back into a normal state.                   	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

And I grant you, this global warming hysteria is destined to go down in history as pseudoscience like all other "scientific" scares and alarmisms: the malthusianism and eugenics that was so popular in Nazi Germany, the overpopulation hysteria during the 70's, the alarmism about the death of the rain forrests and growing deserts during the 80's (why do we never hear about this anymore, do you think?), the acidic-rain-and-forrest-death-alarmism in northern Europe during the same decade (it turned out that the "acidic" rain really made forrests grow _better_, because it works as a fertilizer), and so on.

The EL Nino: Is by global warming amplified and not only like you are trying to make it up only a natural Event - what is very wrong, of course there was a time/era where there was no El Nino at all. An El Nino does depend on very warm weather conditions around the equator/ warmer Pacific decadal oscillation -> so that there can be an "EL Nino" (Extreme of the ENSO), the word EL Nino does not come for no reason, it is an extreme. No only measured in Temps Records which was never reached also not by an El Nino, also very clear by the record breaking devastating impacts to observe with the naked eye for everyone: "Last year 2015 global impacts have already recorded flooding in Somalia, a super-dry South Africa, coral bleaching, and the highest number of forest fires Indonesia has experienced since 1997. In the Northeast United States riding a record with warm winter temperatures including a 70-degree Christmas Eve." 2. LOL The sun is the cause of warming again ? Are you stupid ? You are a fool, this is gossip and just false fact, I never heard such a non-sense in science, the sun is in its normal up and downs and since a while in a Great Sunspot Minimum. I never heard the sun would be the cause or a relevant fact for global warming, this is non-sense. What solar cycle are you making up there ? Fact is: "Various independent measurements of solar activity all confirm the sun has shown a slight cooling trend since 1978." 3. "No temp rise at all between 1998 - 2013" LOL your gossip and made-up non-sense is very funny - I do not know what you read but for sure not scientific based and relevant research. 2010 is still in Raking the 4th hottest year since a long time by +0,70C Degree, also 2009, and 1998 are were breaking global warming record years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record     4. "everybody expected nothing else when they now had a new El Nino period" LOL this was by far the strongest EL Nino ever and was not expected at all, also not the devastating impacts like on corals for example, I never heard such stupid gossip. 5."Of course the global temperature should rise above average, and it have nothing whatsoever to do with CO2 and the alleged greenhouse effect." LOL you are an Idiot, sorry but I do not got time for school drop outs never had education at all. That does speak against simple middle school education and all we know about the anthropogenic climate change, the therm used in science would not be anthropogenic, if that would not be a fact. I think I do not need to explain why this is wrong because every kid today had education in a modern country does know and you are not even on that education level of these kids, but wanna tell us something about science with made-up false facts and gossip and with your lost of reality and false facts you are tell me that my comment was wrong, you are a clown.

No totally wrong 2015 was, i never heard such none sense. 1930s was very low in global anomaly temps under the 0 degree mark, even after 1940 it was a higher global temp anomaly but not to compare of today we are over 1 C degree, this was the highest temperature among all 136 years in the 1880–2015 record; it marks the fourth time a global temperature record has been set this century  and the 17 warmest years on record have all occurred in the last 18 years. 1934 was not a year to mention at all , I do not know where got this from, this is non-sense about 1943 there was a little peak up, but like I said even this you can not compare to 2015. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming#/media/File:Global_Temperature_Anomaly.svg Even if you wanna tell this by a separated measurement like upper or lower atmosphere or only land/only sea global temps, 1930s is totally wrong.

Climate cannot help but change, because it is a non-linear system with multiple variable inputs. You're talking about local weather; not global climate. And you cannot draw a global conclusion from your local experiences. To do so is very, very unscientific. So, it appears you do not have the facts, nor the critical thinking skills to discuss them properly. We live in an Ice Age, and you and others are promoting a fear of warmth, promoting global cooling, and ignoring the dangers of ending the Holocene which is already 500+ years overdue to do so. San Diego will likely survive quite well during the next glacial period of the current Ice Age, but most of North America will not.

People do pay taxes and everyone befits from taxes, this got nothing to do with science it is about politics. 2. No, CO2 is a long term threat to the anthropogenic Climate Change is the right answer. CO2 is again an add to the Atmosphere as a climate Gas, this means also an add to temperatures and it stays long that is why CO2 Emissions are the ones with the most impact also when Water Vapor and Methane do trap more heat but they do not for such a long time then CO2 does.     3. Paris2015 can not prevent us from Mass-Extinction cause by the anthropogenic Climate Change in a few decades, whatever Pars2015 politics can only win some more time, till we may find a solution but from a scientific point of view it is very unlikely to solve this problem and we can not solve it by stopping all Emissions it is too late for doing it, we need to get the heat energy out of the ocean, the glacier back, the Emissions out of the Atmosphere and repairing the Arctic Vortex, Shielding the permafrost near the Arctic from warming and melting . 4.Climatology is still science you can not taking it over, there are research and studies of scientist around the whole world of so many nationalities and the research expeditions in the West-Siberian Arctic does tell you that Climate Change will  going to end everything since over 20 years. So show me that the work of these international research teams 20 years in this location doing nearly everyday scientific work would be wrong please. 5. There has been no warming? Are you mad ? Everyone can tell you in the world you just need to go/ call the next weather station, or every Station in the world - mostly everyone of them will tell you what is going if you never heard of it.  You can also doing it by yourself taking temps every day and next year you make a comparison, then you will only see if the temps do rise in your region and not global, but I think this is enough to grasp the situation, because it does mostly show rising in every locations in the world there are only a few which might not showing temp rising. Why are people not moving to live in the poles if they are getting warmer? We got a rise of 1 degree in Temps globally that does say you are fine as long as there are no weather extremes. If you wanna ask me why did 2000 people in India died this year in a heat summer wave in a few days and did not move to the poles ? I can only answer they had no clue and now they got but they will still stay there until there is no food anymore because of too many years of crop fail. People facing hurricanes, wildfires or an Thaifun very often, do also no move way they mostly stay there.   Why are we still using gas to heat our homes in the winter if the earth is getting warmer ? The gas you use for heating your home for a few days is not so much relevant, in the 1st place unnatural Emissions comes from the energy sector in the 1st place and 2nd Automobiles and Industry/Globalism/Transport. This year I did also only turn on the heat for a few days it is warm here in West Germany a few days ago we had still 20 C degree on daytime at the moment it is about 12 C degree daytime, what is also not called winter in my region it is more like spring. But this is different there are also weather extremes by warming like Washington needs heat they got a cold weather extreme, caused/amplified by global warming. When you got +15 C degree daytime in Winter instead of 0 C degree daytime this is already a big deal that means for mid summer you will have 50 degree daytime instead of 35 degree nothing will go there anymore we all be nearly dead by such Temps, we might have them in 50-80 years and Today only as short term weather extremes near the equator like this year in India.  	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

There has been no warming inn the last 17 years yet Co2 and Methane have been increasing.Why is that?  Why are temperatures not rising .

Yes you are right water vapor is a greenhouse gas, but you got only warming when you add climate gas to atmosphere and this is CO2 and Methane, not water vapor.

The absorption you add to the atmosphere of climate gas does cause warming and there is non water vapor add, but there is CO2 add.

There have period in the past when we had higher Co2 concentrations than the current 400 ppm. The  The  climate models used by IPCC   magnify  the water vapor by 4 to 5 times to get the warming they project. This is not based on actual observed  temperatures or feedback mechanisms that is why  all their projections have been wrong. The projected that there would be 50million climate refugees by 2010. This has not happened. The average global mean temperature has not risen by a statistically significant amount in the last 20 years yet CO2 has been rising  proving that there is no causal relationship. In the climategate emails  one of the scientists admitted that the lack of warming was becoming PR  problem and suggested     that Climate Change might be a better name than Global Warming. That is how they abandoned calling it global warming to climate change  instead of admitting that their science hypothesis is wrong.   What caused the temperatures to rise from the ICE AGE was it CO2?.

Methane in the atmosphere does chemical split up into CO2. CO2 is longterm climate gas and that is why it plays a major role by added into the atmospheric cycle and driving global warming for a very long time period. This is simple primary school knowledge in Chemics, Medicine and Physics and Climatology. CO2 does play a role of global warming because it is an add to the atmosphere, it is very simple to understand and only Climate Gases which do have an add into the atmosphere do cause warming and not which where static before in the atmospheric cycle where there was not much warming and not a climate change. These are simple facts of climatology, you 1st do learn about Greenhouse Gases and the GreenhouseFX. The Oil- and Car industry are preach CO2 would be not effecting the GreenhouseFX and would be harmless, so as EIKE and CFACT does, this is nothing more then gossip and chitchat and not based on scientific work. There are a lot of industry propaganda like smoking would healthy and Oil would be not Fossil, that G-Food is harmless and chlorofluorocarbon would be without FX on our Ozone layer.

Didn't think so. Or how about the medieval warm period 1,000 years ago and then suddenly they e-mailed each other and were told "We need to get rid of the Medieval warm period? Didn't thinks so either.   At this point I can see you are not a "question everything" type of guy as I am.

Or do you think warring factions of religious organizations are going to solve our issues?  As for the IPCC, it was an intergovernmental panel. Of course, they adhered to the political agenda they perceived. What is surprising about that? As for real climate scientists worldwide, they are mostly in consensus about the human factor of climate change. They don't have their head in the sand about this issue. What is your non-scientific view about climate change? I'm imagining it's that there is not problem with 32 yearly Gigatons of CO2, or methane fields that are melting down in Siberia.

UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC.86e2vm7OUOr87M1pWVVndE		0	2015-12-04 20:27:41	Monsterbaby	United Nations IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). When it was set up, (in large part by Canadian, United Nations magnate, Maurice Strong), the people who were put on the IPCC were very carefully selected. In Canada, most were part of the government bureaucracy of Environment Canada. Indeed, no academics outside of government were invited to participate. At the time, Dr. Ball was chairing a Canadian national committee on natural climate fluctuations, where he expressed his view that the jury was still out on whether carbon dioxide causes climate change. So he was asked to step down as chair of this national climate committee. Thus, we see that the IPCC outcome was predetermined because of who was asked to serve on the IPCC. Nothing like a little insurance to promulgate the deception. Working Group 1. The IPCC was divided into three working groups, each group was to build on the work of the previous group ONLY. This is not a wholly improper scientific technique, as it helps define the scope of the work. However, here we see the scope defined in the early 90s (actually much earlier) as being only that which might arise as a result of man’s activities. Working Group 1 built on those. Does this mean that WG2 and WG3 can only consider the work of WG1 on the result of human activities? Yes. So now they consider ANY warming to be strictly  anthropogenic  without ANY weight given to natural warming. So Yes, it's all about hyping the propaganda. I'm sorry, the IPCC is not the angels you think they are. I would think by now you would be wise enough to understand how agenda's work. @Mick Mack	UCWXt8-VwwYfen4VIElJEBgg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWXt8-VwwYfen4VIElJEBgg	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

In which field should that might be the science of speculation ? 1. Science is not about theories, there are just a few theories which describes things by relevant facts or simulations, we are not able to understand or never will understand, but science is more then 99% research and proven by experiments, math, laws and observations and not by theories at all. 2. Companies do science for profit not for science and education, mostly these results are of course Trade Secrets or Patents and these results are mostly important for products but pointless for discoveries and research. 3. Yes results also Data are there to support a scientific statements, so what ? 4. There is no deleting possible when you published them, also not when the work is not right, because there might be also new hints or new ways in the work to make discoveries. 5. As a scientist and research by the state you mostly do not loose your job, also when there is no progress in the field you are working and when you work for a company in the field of science this is mostly related to products or a service, so when your work is bad the product/service does not make a progress or the fail production will end in a lot of lost budget/profit and you will loose your job of course, but this kind of research is mostly a secret of the company or end in a patent and not open for public of course there is competition and there is not much cheating or lying possible because the results will end up in a product or service. 6. What theory ? Again there are no theories in science, we all know just a few ones, which are the most been rechecked and been researched again and again. 7. A scientist can not lie about results, he can only be wrong about it. Sorry but I do not know and never hear such a non-sense you are talking about. A scientist can lie and cheat, but this will not help, because in a company his results will end up in production failures and in science/research all the work will be checked by 1000 of others scientists important new results and discoveries are so important for their own work and to make a progress of cause and these new results and discoveries are very rare in many fields, because we mostly did discover everything in many fields. So you are very hard to understand with your weird story, I never heard about that a scientist can lie and cheat about his work without getting feedback for his errors and failures. There might be themes without any important results you might can cheat, like: "Is washing hair better for having intensive sex?" from a psychological point - What is pointless for mostly every scientist. But when you do research in the main fields are familiar with biology, chemics, physics, math, history, geology, climatology, astrology... everyone in the world is surprised by new discoveries/results and will check them to make a progress or because it will have an impact on their on work and research.

The Phrase "Figures Don’t Lie, but Liars Figure" happens much more often than I ever thought it would. People are the problem when it comes to science. As I've noticed in my career with several different companies I've worked for is that people (scientists) come up with a theory as to why something is happening and instead of letting the data either prove or disprove their theory, they delete, truncate or alter the data to "prove" their theory was correct. Most of the time the individual scientist that does this is either snowing the management above them or doing it so as to save their job. I've also witnessed that the higher up in an organization these people are the more likely they are to "adjust" their data to meet their theory.    It is a misconception of people to think that somehow scientists are a species all their own that don't bow to money and or influences in their realm. They are human and unfortunately a lot of humans lie, cheat and steal. That my friend is fact and peer reviewed.

You can not debate about climate sorry, because climate is a scientific field. In science you do not debate or guess or might take a point of view of something, it is just about research and results and if they are right and wrong and still there you can not debate or make a point of view, then you have to disprove it by relevant scientific facts which shows why something is wrong, or showing by relevant scientific work and research, results why something else is right. Because the person is not wrong, only the work he/she has done could be wrong and that is all what matters in science and you can not just claim something is wrong you need facts, research and a scientific work to do so. In politics and Media you debate and you have a point of view, but science does not care, not because science is arrogant, it is just about facts and you can not tell facts to be wrong or just saying them I wish for something else to be true. You can also debate if everything in our solar system is local moving around the sun, but this whole debate does not matter at all, what you will say there or what you wish for is completely irrelevant, or what you start might guess about it - no one cares at all, the only relevant thing is research by observing or math, or physics ... and to right this all down in a scientific work, or to just disprove and find an error about the scientific fact why everything in our Solar system is moving around the sun. And there are Millions of experts who will watch this work, because it will be important for their own work to progress and to move on in research, results, discoveries so they will notice or use your work and notice if the Results are right or an error was made and they are wrong, or the work need more content/specifications/definition of research  and facts to be really right in the end.      	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

With CO2 it is the similar, very important is the in the end the particles we did nearly double of CO2, thats why there is so much heat trapping. Natural CO2 not caused by global warming was there before, and did caused natural warming so much we just need, but these did only change by adding more CO2 not because the CO2 level is static. The warming today does create more heat trapping and also more natural CO2 but of caused by our emissions which did heat up the planet and not because nature just saying here is more CO2 I will release this for no reason, the only reason for heating up is the CO2 and emissions we did add to the atmosphere of course, this very simple to understand.There is nothing heating up because there is no change in the system, it has a cause and this is about our emissions and not something you can just make-up like it is scientific proven so often.       	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

These 2% you are talking about is by far too much, because we did rise the CO2 level up to 400 ppm this is the problem and what is trapping heat for a long time. We got now the highest CO2 level in the atmosphere since 15 to 20 millions years. Only because that 2% of the total CO2 level in the atmosphere does not sound much to you and you are not able to grasp what this mean, does not say it is not relevant. A glass which is full you do not add also 2% of water because it is too much and you will also not use 0,001% of Botulinum Toxin compared to the mass of your body, because it will kill you, also when it so less you will not even see with the naked eye. Our Climate system is sensitive and when you add every year 550 Giga Tons of CO2 this is of cause relevant, it is readable in the global temperature and has a great impact on our climate and on evolved life on earth.         	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

You do know he has made 100's of millions of dollars in shares from companies that benefit directly from AGW? Look here's what they're doing..they make a false climate model to show a total man made disaster, get us to give them billions in carbon taxes, re-change the climate model to show the disaster has been stopped, say it's our carbon taxes that have saved humanity, say we need to keep paying them or AGW will start all over again, keep is living in fear and they have much more control over us - this is greed and corruption.

I do estimate a devastating impact of AGW starting in 30 years, as long as we do not something about it or too less, so then there will be a mass extinction starting to taking place in near future. But of course this will 1st start around the equator and in country with to short and less food supply and a growing crop failure rate, with a lot of emigration movements of a lot of people and 1st there will be an mass extinction by some animals and plants which will be effected to most by global warming and extreme weathers and changing climate zones. It is very likely you will be still there in 20-30 years, but you will also see and feel the impact and the start of mass extinction and not only of mankind starting in some places of the world. If you did not get it, this already started in the past we have a growing crop failure rate by extreme weather and shifting seasons and we do have impacts on animals and plants and ocean life which is showing clearly these all effected lifeforms today will have hard time to survive in near future and the rise of AGW. I did ask you questions, so you can not just claim I would not do so, were my questions not marked good enough with ????? You did not respond my questions I did ask, not even a single one of it. Media is media when you are saying there is cycle and there might be already an Ice Age started, they say we are all dying tomorrow there will be an Ice Age, because they do not much research that such an Ice Age will take 100 or 1000 of years before you will be effected by an Ice Age in one of the natural cycle we know so far. The media is in the 1st place entertaining, so there are not much things getting right by media, also a mass extinction by AGW might very likely start in 30 years, we all will not just die in one week or a day, this will take a long, long time until everything will be gone over many years or decades, this is not a movie like the day after tomorrow or such a non-sense we are talking about facts and reality and not media imaginations. Yea of course it is clear that AGW is getting worser and worser like it is clear to see in the Arctic and in the Oceans and it is still clear it will get by far much worser in near future and you think we will take back the impact of AGW ? How should we do this already today, do you think we are capable of getting the glaciers back, the Arctic Ice, corals, microbes and shell life in the ocean, heat waves, droughts, extreme weathers, high temps ? You need a lot to fix already to hide and take back the situation which AGW did already cause, to make AGW just not visible. It was already in the middle of this year 2015 clear that this year 2015 is a global warm recored in a time frame of 150 years and also when there are fluctuations in the global temps, it is very likely the record will be beaten or near this record in the next year 2016. So you do not need to wait for holding up a hoax hope, it is just clear to see where we are going and where we will end, if you look 50 years back or check the situation right now, or guess what will obviously happen in the next coming years. But it is also natural to think critical and do not believe something like we will have a dramatic change here on the whole globe in 30-50 years, but not by the non-sense you are talking about like there is no global warming, everything is OK, there is no AGW, there is no impact. It is ok to say I do not believe this, I do not trust this, I will need to check research on this and that..., but when you do so you do not ask a political speaker like Christopher Monckton about climate, you just google for example for crop failure rate and read about or corals or arctic vortex, technical terms where you will find research and a debate or an opinion about it, true facts a man just did study and research over lot of years and what the conclusions are, Christopher Monckton does not do this at all, he got no clue about the AGW he did just claim some data he found where not right because of his own personal interests and the other people he is working and speaking for.

We do add GigaTons of emissions every hour to the atmosphere. In 1st place as most devastating problem CO2 as a greenhouse gas in the atmospheric cycle from 220 ppm to 360 ppm in a few years.  We did also double the methane in the atmospheric cycle up to over 1800 ppm, which will become a CO2 problem too because of chemical reactions methane is splitting up in the atmosphere and a part of it will be transformed into CO2. 2. Yes CO2 is a greenhouse gas it does trap heat energy from the sun on earth. 3. CO2 does drive temperatures, but I do not know how much Al Gore did statement, but as you can see we did break this year the 1 C degree mark and CO2 is long time greenhouse gas what does say the CO2 we did add as a plus to the atmosphere will be there and warm up everything for many decades no matter what you do. 4. Scare Tacs does not change something. Climate is serious and we are the cause, we can stop being the cause if this is still possible, or we can just all die, there is nothing scary about it, these are just the facts, you are speaking about. If this scares you just go to cry for a while till it is over, or get yourself professional help, there are many solutions to fight own fears, you can also do survival trainee and store a lot of long date food if this will make you com, before you can do a realistic decision and useful solutions to a problem will have an impact not on your egoistic fear, it will have on everyone here. 5. Carbon Taxes are useful and technical the 1st solution to do, because you can not stop something when causing it all the time. (Like you can not empty a glass of wine when you are always filling up the glass.) There is not scientific, chemical or technical wonderland, which can just solve this problem world wide in a few years, we all would like to have. 6. The Anthropogenic Climate Change is everywhere to see today and got everywhere impacts, there is no need to troll and foul someone with dumb conspiracy theories you did find somewhere.

We are talking about Gigatons of CO2 in every hour world wide and CO2 as an unnatural emitter by mankind is growing as emissions form year to year we did not even stop the rate growing of co2 emission in the last 20 years enough to be static in the emission output. Methane and Water is much more emitting, but methane is going to become an CO2 problem because it does chemical react in the atmosphere over 15-20 years and water and methane is mostly natural and not added to the atmosphere, this was always there in the atmospheric cycle. Also when methane does also become more and more the problem and did rise to over 1800 ppm in the atmosphere, still CO2 is the 1st problem, because it is there for a very, very long time and will keep us also a long time very warm. And there is no one hiding that the most CO2, Methane, Water Vapor is not caused natural. There is also no problem and no conflict or danger, when it was there before in the atmospheric cycle. It does only get a problem when we add this to the cycle directly by emissions or by causing global warming that more natural greenhouse gases will be added into this cycle and stay there, what will cause even more global warming and led to a run away climate change and tipping point. These are simple climate facts know by everyone with primary school knowledge. Carbon taxes do make sense atm but not anymore in a few years, because it will be much too late then to cut down emissions and trying to take away our economical impact onto the Climate and atmosphere. We have to make the choice today, do we murder millions of people for extreme changes in the economy running by fossil fuels and the consume of it, or do we just end it all and nothing will survive.  	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

Yes in the 60ties and 70ties there was the fear of an Ice age by the missunderstanding media, you are talking about the earth long term cycles about 100000 years or the 41000 year cycle. You have to know such an Ice age does not appear tomorrow, they got a time frame over 1000 of years, it can also be that one of this cycle already did started 100 of years ago, but you will never feel this and it takes a very long time till this Ice Age does appear. When you are not talking of this Ice Age you need to specified. So what are you talking about? There is also an Ice Age might be possible to appear very fast, because of  the Anthropogenic Climate Change , which does slow down the gulf stream, this might happen in a very short time, but it is unknown and unsure if such an Ice Age will ever taking place. But this is not from the 60ties and 70ties as far as I know, otherwise I do not know an Ice Age, which could be possible appear in the next years, instead we are talking of negative feedbacks of the Anthropogenic Climate Change. 2. There is no theory about AGW, please learn simple things about Climate and all the research made the last years in so many fields of science. The Anthropogenic Climate Change got 1000 tons of scientific papers, because the impact is clear to see world wide everywhere, if you are doing research in Chemics, Biology, Meteorology, Climatology, Oceanology, Geology, Physics, Glaciology, Geomorphology, Hydrology or Ecology and so on the Anthropogenic Climate Change is to find there everywhere, because there is global warming without a natural cause. A simple example is the study of corals where it took years to prove the ocean warming as cause of bleaching corals, because there where many factors like fishing, tourism, wind and storm variation, changing of the biotope in the coral life system, pollution and so on... also when it was know corals have a feedback of temps of the water and oceans, it took years to make clear that a lot of corals are bleaching and dying because of global warming and not only by another factor. And this only an example of millions, because the Anthropogenic Climate Change has an impact everywhere in nature, if you do microorganisms, birds, plants, aerobes, mammals, chemical compositions in nature, ocean life, glacier research and million tons of subjects more where the impact is clear to see of global warming.  3. And like I said the models say nothing scientific they are just there to show politics the output/outcome of the Anthropogenic Climate Change as a trend in the future, what is the work of the IPPC. Simulations or Models are just there to have an trend, which is used everywhere today like to make Car, a Plane much saver Crash-Simulations, to build architectures earthquake resistance, to simulate chemical structures, in Flight, Tanks and other vehicles simulations, but all this simulations are only close to reality. They do help a lot, but they are not reality so thus they are not exact the same and you will get a bit different results in reality. But Models got nothing to do, not even the tiniest thing, why there is an Anthropogenic Climate Change today and in the last years. Models do not display reality and do not prove facts why there is  an Anthropogenic Climate Change and there is no person in whole world would claim that models are a relevant prove or evidence for an Anthropogenic Climate Change.  Are you able to grasp that simple fact ? You are just coming up with conspiracy theories like media, politics and economy does, but this all is just false fact debating VS scientific reality and proves. You can not debate this, you need to disprove these tons of facts in every field which shows clearly the Anthropogenic Climate Change and start learn simple facts about climate and not just watching some data you do not understand at all. And there are also examples for people who did disprove false research about the Anthropogenic Climate Change, but still there are these tons of facts and research showing clearly the  Anthropogenic Climate Change. When you are saying "Once I took it upon myself to do my own research it became clear nobody had the data or the facts to make the claim of AGW." I wanna see your research. In which field you did not find data and facts of the Anthropogenic Climate Change ? And where does it disprove the Anthropogenic Climate Change ? And I hope you are not wasting our time by posting now CFACT, EIKE or Think Thank debates of the oil industry claiming we found data sheets we did misinterpret about climate or another conspiracy theory. 	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

Sorry. Growing up in the 60's and 70's the fear was another Ice age was coming. When that didn't prove out to be true they shifted gears and created the THEORY of AGW, I too used to believe wholeheartedly in the what I was told regarding this issue. Once I took it upon myself to do my own research it became clear nobody had the data or the facts to make the claim of AGW. It is all speculation. Models are just that...models. With any computer program, garbage in garbage out. That is why absolutely none of the climate "Models" have been anywhere near accurate. The concerning part to real scientists is the fact that NONE of these "Models" ever forecast temp trends LOWER than what they are....ZERO of them.

But you can not manipulate global Temps this would be clear to see for a lot of scientists, global temps are made out of many sources and will be rechecked by different scientists who do know how warm it was in these time periods. All the meteorologists and weather stations, satellite data analysis, researchers in the Arctic of the Ice, would recheck and draw attention to it, if there would be false facts in global temps, also when these data would be incorrect to all the different institutes, which are collecting the global temps data to recheck them, too. Climate models are there to simulate where the climate will be in the future by so much relevant data then possible by many sources and not saying that the anthropogenic climate change is not real, when the IPPC simulations are not exactly right for the future, it is because it is called a trend and the IPPC is only the gap between science and politics to show politicians with no clue at all, where climate change is directing to in the future and not telling us that the anthropogenic climate change would be not going on for decades. For these simulations they need a lot of input much more then just the global temps also all the variables which do explain increasing and decreasing temps of course, thats what it is all about.        	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

I don't suppose you read at the NASA website that all temperature measurements have a +/- 0.46 degrees C error did you. No I didn't think you'd actually read the whole thing. That means (and I'll explain it in small minded terms you can understand) that the "Warming"  noticed since 1880 in less than the 0.94 Degrees Centigrade of error the satellites are capable of reading. So if all the warming is Anthropogenic then who warmed the earth in the Cambrian era to 25 C?  and 4 other times since also to 25 C. ? The average temperature of the Earth is 17 C. right now we average 13.7 C. So  until the Earth goes over 27 C (the highest average ever) I'm not going to get all panicky like you and spew non-factual  "evidence" like you.

Warming is clearly anthropogenic, because there are no relevant natural events, which can cause the rapid climate change we got today is the fact, so what the hell are you talking about ? 2. Earth has no cooling event and NASA shows clearly it is getting warmer and warmer. We had a 1.4 F of global Temp rise till now. "The 10 warmest years in the 134-year record all have occurred since 2000, with the exception of 1998. The year 2014 ranks as the warmest on record."  NASA Quote. I guess you did take a look on data by yourself and did not understand how to interpret them right like Mr. Mockton or Mr. Ted Cruz likes to fool themselfs ? 3. The UN got nothing to do with global warming and climate change of course, also not when and how the weather is today and also nothing if earth is flat or rounded. All about Climate is based on Facts, no matter what politics says it can not make this wrong or right, there has to be facts for this, which will be world wide proven to be right or wrong !! So what the hell are you talking about ? 4. Climate Change is not a debate and not a maybe and not a wannabe, it based on facts and nothing what I say or you or someone else just say, does make a point. The only point would be by a scientific work which will prove something else right or disprove scientific work that has been done all the years. Even If I would get a paycheck by the UN or by Oil and Car Industry or pocket money from daddy, this will not change these facts written down in scientific work and knowledge in so many professional Subjects for over years and decades, so when you talk about climate change you need to read a lot of scientific papers about it and not the useless oil industry and political wannaHAVE lecture. They only know the term "Research" because of the Alzheimer's disease and thats it.   You did not even grasp the very simple terms like global warming, glacier melting, climate fluctuation, greenhouse effect and greenhouse gases, emissions, sea level rise, anthropogenic Climate Change.... which are know by everyone with primary school knowledge since the 60ties and every kid can draw you a nice colored picture of these themes in a few min., not even to mention or to try to talk with you about scientific terms like positive feedback, CH4, El Niño cycle, salinity, polar vortex and so on...     	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

You know nothing about anthropogenic climate change ? There is no believing possible in climate change it is based on observed and scientific facts when I want to deny these facts I need to come up with relevant new facts or disproof these facts by science, reality does not change by believing, sorry we are not living in a tale story.  The UN is not only an organization, there are a lot of nations with different political interests like China and the USA never did respond to climate change but they all did know the scientific facts, but China and USA did change their point of view since it is becoming very critical also when this will damage their economy and china will loose their leading position in economy and as the world power. But this is all politics and science is not political, in science you have to work and do research by facts and not by a fairy tale, and facts do not f****ing care for your opinion or your attitude they are just facts, if you like them or not.   	UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA	1	UgjgLgPmnna_fngCoAEC	Mick Malkemus, MS

The climate is NOT constantly changing. Who does talk such non-sense ? There is climate change in erath history but when the earth did cool down it is very balanced in climate and the climate is only changing natural by circles of the earth around the sun. But since the industry revolution the climate is getting hotter very rapid. 3. In 70s there was not a cooling trend at all it was getting warmer still. You really know nothing about climate ?

Or the average global mean temperature over the last 6 million years where 80% of the time was over 17 degrees C. for a mean temp and reached 24 degrees C. over 60% of that time or that the last 18 years and 9 months has had a slight cooling. I believe your kind calls it the "Great Pause". The 97% consensus (even though consensus is NOT science) was 11,944 abstracts that Cook et al. (2013) that 7,930 expressed no opinion on AGW and 3,896 marked as agreeing but not knowing how much is caused by man and 64 marked as endorsing AGW consensus as defined  by the UN and 41 ACTUALLY endorsed AGW as defined by the UN.

If your dispute is with NASA, the organisation who put man into space and on the moon in the 60's, then you are one dumb cunt and should die and stop wasting our oxygen. Please see reference below. "In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet. The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to 400 parts per million in the last 150 years. The panel also concluded there's a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50 years."

Ugj2FS2CSfAolHgCoAEC.85fWhBzMBhO8qPPjn8Pi8w		1	2019-01-22 11:58:28	Joe Capocci	​@Jed Lawson As a chemistry graduate and researcher at the University of Liverpool, I've taken part in many research groups and poured over the data on climate change for some time now. It is by no means a 'government' based hoax, the evidence is clear as day, the impact we are having on the environment is already not sustainable which is only going to be exaggerated as population increases. The people that are doing this research, like me, are just normal people doing their jobs or getting their degrees, not brainwashed 'Big government' conspirators. Its actually costing governments and business billions to create green incentives, look up the circular economy, it would be much more finically beneficial to continue to dump toxic by-products, or not have to come up with clever systems to reuse waste emissions instead of just releasing them, or doing RnD into new more sustainable technologies, etc I could go on. This WOULD NOT be happening if it wasn't based entirely in fact, this is the only time ever industry has not been driven solely by monetary gain, morality has intercepted. I think people in this thread who claim to be the ones aware to the world are in fact the ones brainwashed, look at the correlation with public speakers and politicians that oppose climate chain and those with finical backing from the petroleum industry, look at John Mcain, he was staunchly in favour of climate change but when he received 5 million in campaign funds from shell and instantly he changed his opinion..... Oil/ gas and coal are the special interest parties convincing a subsection of people into believing this is a hoax, thankfully those 'sheeple' aren't the majority anymore.

When you go to the blog you can immediately see my post "A Call to Action". It can be seen already by the public. I put it up not so long ago. It has two parts to it. A suggestion of six tools to force the governments of the world to figure out what the right thing to do is and to act on it. The other part is a description of our current situation with respect ot the climate crisis. Unfortunately I have made the error of assuming that the stabilization table (table 1 in the post) is a predictor of future temperatures given that we reach the displayed CO2 equivalent conentrations of greenhouse gases. In reality the table is a predictor of how warm the earth would get assuming we stay at the displayed concentration until the energy the earth receives is in balance with the energy the earth radiates to space. This error has some consequences for other parts of the document and as a result the situation for humanity is a bit better than my document paints. I will correct this as soon as I find time for it, But I don' think I should wait to tell you about it. My thinking is that if enough people do what my six tools say, then we have a chance at preventing the worst things from happening in our future. Try to promote it for me. I will fix the errors as soon as I can. Regards Patrick Lincoln	UC_NlA1tUXHnYMjOsd3gjkZw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_NlA1tUXHnYMjOsd3gjkZw	1	Ugj2FS2CSfAolHgCoAEC	Shadow Man

We are locked in for bad stuff (we don't know exactly how bad it is). But we will very likely get ourselves locked in for (minimally) a large reduction in the size of the human population which will play out in the latter half of this century. There is a chance that we can avoid mass deaths by employing geoingeenering with sulfate that are engineered to migrate to the poles (David Keith's idea). This might work. But it will probably only work if we can get emissions reduced quickly. So let's fight for it. Got any ideas?

And that runaway greenhouse started ages ago, like 1990's or earlier. The general public is so polarised on this issue. A couple of people commented under my video that have a similar view to yourself. But most people seem to be either doomers like me, or think solar panels and nuclear power can save us, or otherwise are just plain ignorant like your typical Trump voter. They don't even think about this issue. Perhaps think Jesus will return soon flying on a white horse. I've had some private chat with Guy thru fb messenger. Early on I said Gee, I need to come up with a profound question to ask you, he replied, 'I don't have profound answers'. I think it's sensible to take Guy Mac with a grain of salt, simply because he goes for the absolute worst case scenario. But you can't fault his logic. An ice free Arctic will have some very serious effects. Methane release, reduced albedo, moistening of the troposphere, warming of the Greenland ice sheet, further melt of the permafrost,messed up jetstream. Slowing of the ocean currents, affecting Europe. Perhaps the biggest problem with an ice free Arctic is the release of latent heat. It takes a huge amount of energy to melt ice. Notice how warm your beers get in an ice bucket, so soon after the ice melts. Guy Mac also talks about ecology. The big picture. The extinction rate. Loss of keystone species like pollinators and filter feeders. Death of phytoplankton which helps give us oxygen to breathe. There's never enough talk about this type of thing. The vast majority of animals walking the earth are either humans or farm animals. Not wild animals.

I can't see why the feedbacks wouldn't be multiplicative. Feedback loops like moistening of the troposphere don't act in isolation, and anyway, even conservative projections of the effect of increased H2O in the atmosphere alone point to a big jump in world temps over the next few years. Then add or multiply the effects of methane, reduced albedo, latent heat, extra CO2, less trees, more people, more agriculture, more cars and trucks, more shipping, more coal plants and household appliances. There's at least a 10 year lag between CO2 emissions and actual warming of the planet, so the industrialisation of the 3rd world hasn't hit yet. Indonesians eat more meat than they used to, same with China. So we are locked into multiple degs rise in the near future. The environment is sensitive, as we have seen with the fires in Scandinavia. Further chaos with the jetstream. Further scarcity of fresh water like in Capetown, Sth Africa.

I guarantee you civilization will still be here in 5 years barring unexpected events such as a massive nuclear war, supernova explosion from Beetleguese where the beam of energy just happens to point straight at earth, or an out of control pandemic. It is going to take longer than that. I think bad stuff is going to happen, but that we have a choice about how bad it is going to be. Whether civilization collapses, whether we become extinct is as far as I can tell right now still a choice. And if you have been getting your source info from Guy McPherson Watch out. He says strange things like climate feedback mechanisms are multiplicative. To see why this is a weird thing to say, consider a climate system with 20 massive feedback mechanisms and one typical sized negative feedback mechanisms. In McPherson land the net effect is a massive cooling (because they are multiplicative). This is not reality. If you give me a link to your video I might help you with some insight. If I were to make an anology I think that humanity is approaching a knife's edge. You think we have already passed the knife's edge in the sense that you believe that we are locked in for civilization collapse (or possible extinction) already. I say not so fast. The mainstream scientists are giving a slightly rosier picture of reality. What they communicate is close enough to the truth. James Hansen is an excellent example of a scientist who does a good job pointing out what the true state of affairs is. I hope this helps. This all means that we should be very motivated to fight for the future generations right to a survivable habitat. We have work to do. I hope this helps.

Before humans started chopping down the forests and burning fossil fuels the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was at 280 parts per million. Now it is at 409 parts per million (where it is climbing at 3 parts per million per year thanks to emissions). It was otherwise stable at 280 parts per million for 10,000 years. If we get to 1000 parts per million, then you wont be able to open your window anymore to get fresh air, because 1000 parts per million is the threshold where humans can detect that the room is too stuffy. Give that some thought. And if you don't believe me do a Google search for "nasa CO2" and you will see the graphs that show that the CO2 concentrations really are growing that fast and if you google "CO2 stuffy room threshold" and you click on the first link you find, you will see that 1000 parts per million of CO2 to 2000 parts per million of CO2 are concentrations that cause complaints of drowsiness and poor air. Forget global Warming if you don't believe in it. WE ARE RUINING OUR AIR!!! I gave good evidence and I made it easy for you to follow up on it. Please reconsider your policies.

During the same time period, CO2 concentrations increased, ergo no cause and effect here. The mainstream media, including once trustworthy science publications (and science/environmental organizations) are still withholding these and other salient, climate science facts from the public—most of them are willing propagandists for the most massive scientific deception of all time, duped or bought by the now $1.5 trillion &quot;manmade climate change&quot; industry. The UN/IPCC-led fake, non-existent planetary climate emergency is being used as a smoke screen for the UN&#39;s bid for global governance, forced wealth redistribution, and an end to national sovereignty and democratic freedoms. The UN plans to clinch the deal this December in Paris at the Orwellian-sounding Conference of the Parties (190 countries) with a legally binding and universal agreement on climate that would put an unelected, unaccountable UN in charge. THAT is the clear and present danger your children and grandchildren face—a fossil-fuel-free world in which every aspect of their lives, with a greatly reduced standard of living, is monitored and controlled, harassed, constrained, and harmed. Do your own research and get at the truth, and speak out before it&#39;s too late.	UCo9DajPjz7WmCYTazx48Dlw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo9DajPjz7WmCYTazx48Dlw	0

Carbon Capture and Storage is quite expensive and it has risks, so if you could figure out a better way to extract CO2 from the atmosphere, then all governments and climate scientists would want to hear about it. If that doesn't happen, then renewable subsidies and a carbon tax would be done if the best ways to *accelerate* the transition to renewables. And putting a price on carbon, to better represent the true costs to society, means that markets would be able to work correctly; this is known as accounting for an 'externality', and economic theory shows that markets cannot operated correctly in the presence of externalities. I didn't suggest corruption, but I think you were just being argumentative. "Infinite amounts of money" ??? You're being ridiculous. The cost of solar is halving every ~5 years, and the cost of wind energy is decreasing too.

If you, or anyone else, is able to arrive at a better means of reaching that goal, then I, all governments and all climate researchers want to hear about it ASAP. I would personally donate thousands of dollars to help reach that end. Germany is voluntarily reducing emissions, and China, which has a government that can do whatever the heck it wants, will be implementing a carbon tax in 2017 and it's also putting $6.6 trillion towards its climate action plan. And renewables have already reached price parity with carbon-based energy, and renewables are now offering a long term trend of decreasing prices, as well as offering far greater opportunity for employment than fossil fuels. Btw, the consensus is that the majority of the recent increase in global average temperature is attributable to the increase in atmospheric CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels.

Governments are bound by their constitution to protect the lives of their citizens, therefore absolute proof IS NOT REQUIRED when making economic, military, or medical decisions. There are no grounds for absolute proof, especially when there are significant risks to humans, and especially when adopting a wait-and-see approach will increase the risk of harm. (Read up on epistemic norms in science). Economists have shown that even if there's only a 5% risk of the worst-case climate change scenario occurring by 2100, is sufficient grounds to devalue current endowments by 10%, with an further devaluation of 0.5% for each additional year.  Companies have a legal duty to reduce the long term risks to investors. That's why companies like Apple, Bank of America, Cargill, Pacific Gas & Electric Co, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Google, Levi Strauss & Co., Microsoft, PepsiCo, UPS and Walmart are urging the government to take action on climate change, and those (and many other) companies are now declaring risks that investors' may be exposed to.  Why do you think that China, the communist country, is now committing $6.6 trillion to its climate action plan? Why do you think it, like an increasing number of countries, is putting a price on carbon? Even India is getting on board. And studies have shown that income disparity is a far greater predictor of the poor outcomes for citizens, than having a high average income. So, as long as one is beyond the poverty line, then accruing further wealth has diminishing returns. 	UCsi84creytiQfWSR5RgpTNg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsi84creytiQfWSR5RgpTNg	1	UgjMrli47ZsfhngCoAEC	fungussa

And you're mistaken, reliable temperature measurements started in 1880. And every means by which one can determine the heat content of the Earth, shows the Earth is warming. The increase in land and ocean surface temperature, the long term retreat of glaciers, the long term trend in land ice melt, the shortening of winters, the lengthening of summers, the long term increase in sea level height, the warming of the oceans, the long term increasing in atmospheric water vapour concentration.

(Don't think I don't know why you didn't go earlier....the earth was probably cooling prior to that while we increased our CO2 emissions) Of course we really don't have any global temp measurements before the 1980s so there is no way anyone can claim to know exactly what the climate is doing. Everything before satellites is only a small portion of the planet typically concentrated in the northern hemisphere and not including the oceans (71% of the planet). The best guess we can make shows a correlation between temp and CO2 only from the late 70s to the late 90s. 20 years out of the 150+ years in the current warming period. That's right...the warming period started in the 1800s....well before our CO2 emissions could be a factor. Kind of a problem for those who claim the climate never changes without human intervention. (The true "climate change deniers") And your overall claim rests on the idea that "the earth is warming....therefore that proves we are doomed". Isn't a convincing argument for anything other than an illustration of how human being typically see a bogey man in every shadow. Naturally a lot of people see everything as "bad". Cooling is bad of course...now warming is bad too. So anything the earth does is bad. And the human ego immediately rushes to claim everything that happens is due to our actions. We are sooooo important. We see this in all religion. Man is the center of everything that happens and of course is the reason the earth will be destroyed. Our "sins" are the cause. Pretty funny how little has changed. So despite your claims, the IPCC projections for temp rise were wrong. The satellites show no warming for almost 19 years.

Kiribati isn't sinking: http://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/03/09/kiribati-on-the-move-not-sinking/ "Climate scientists have expressed surprise at findings that many low-lying Pacific islands are growing, not sinking. Islands in Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia are among those which have grown, largely due to coral debris, land reclamation and sediment. The findings, published in the magazine New Scientist, were gathered by comparing changes to 27 Pacific islands over the last 20 to 60 years using historical aerial photos and satellite images. Auckland University’s Associate Professor Paul Kench, a member of the team of scientists, says the results challenge the view that Pacific islands are sinking due to rising sea levels associated with climate change. “Eighty per cent of the islands we’ve looked at have either remained about the same or, in fact, gotten larger,” he said. “Some of those islands have gotten dramatically larger, by 20 or 30 per cent. “We’ve now got evidence the physical foundations of these islands will still be there in 100 years.” But, the article continues [bold mine]:- Dr Kench says *the growth of the islands can keep pace with rising sea levels*."

As atmospheric water vapour concentration has increased by 4% in the last 35 years, which will obviously lead to more extreme precipitation in some areas. ----------- Crop yields: Noting some benefit, to some plants, should not be considered ‘enormous’. “Food quality will suffer with rising carbon dioxide, field study shows” http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140406162420.htm “Increased carbon dioxide levels in air restrict plants' ability to absorb nutrients” http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150612104016.htm “Carbon dioxide could reduce crop yields”   http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121130094918.htm --------- Consensus: Anderegg 2010, Doran 2009, Cook 2013, Oreskes 2004.

Co2science.org: And you need to view Idso’s blog with at least some suspicion, as he doesn’t provide transparency about the sources of his funding. And one of the key issues with Idso’s position, is that he doesn’t have ANY evidence to support his ‘natural factors account for warming’ hypothesis. Neither the sun, nor volcanic aerosols, nor Milankovich cycles, nor ocean currents, nor cosmic rays can account for the long term warming trend. And the evidence is very clear on this, yet he fails to mention it. So he instead choose to take a position not supported by evidence, whilst refuting broad evidence of 1) The rate of increase in global temperature is very high. 2) That the primary cause of that warming is due to the increase in atmospheric CO2.

Secondly only 41 of the 11944 papers explicitly stated that they agreed that man had caused most of the warming since 1950.

So whilst deniers, like Monckton, are a curiosity in psychology studies they have absolutely nothing to contribute to the advancement of climate science. They are also a threat to the prosperity of younger and future generations, and history will not look on them kindly.

(Climate deals with 'long-term trends', typically 30 years, but even on shorter time-scales, there's very broad evidence of continued warming) All of the evidence supports the same conclusion: 1) the continuation in long term sea level rise, 2) the continued retreat of more than 90% of the world's glaciers, 3) the long term trend in the accumulation of ocean heat, 4) satellites are continuing to measure more radiation entering the upper atmosphere than is escaping from it 5) the continued long term increase in atmospheric water vapour concentration 6) the hottest decades, in increasing order, are: 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010-2019 is on course to be the warmest of all, 7) plant and animal species are continuing a long term trend of net annual migration towards the poles and / or higher altitude.8) Greenland, the Arctic, Alaska and the Antarctic are all on a long term trend of losing ice MASS 9) The list goes on and on.. So your criticism are comprehensively debunked.	UCsi84creytiQfWSR5RgpTNg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsi84creytiQfWSR5RgpTNg	1	UgjMrli47ZsfhngCoAEC	fungussa

That there hasn't been any warming since December 1996, contrary to the 1990 predictions of the IPCC, isn't a "broad, sweeping'" claim.

A video by Potholer54 (geologist and journalist) titled "Monckton bunkum Part 5 -- What, MORE errors, my lord?" mentions *21 examples* as summarised from earlier videos in the series. He questioned Monckton about it, provided evidence and invited him to debate it... But Monckton refused. Not linking it as youtube tends to ghost-ban them, just look it up on youtube.
