RGHE has it wrong. <br /><br />Fact 2: Because of the significant non-radiative heat transfer participation of the contiguous atmospheric molecules, BB LWIR upwelling &quot;extra&quot; energy from the surface for GHGs to &quot;trap&quot; is not possible. RGHE has it wrong. <br /><br />Fact 3: No &quot;extra&quot; energy for GHGs means they cannot create any terrestrial warming. This hypothetical GHG warming loop also violates conservation of energy, perpetual motion and cold to hot without work. RGHE has it wrong. <br /><br />Fact 4: Zero RGHE = Zero GHG terrestrial warming = Zero man caused global warming or climate change. <br /><br />I don&#39;t explain acronyms.

I doubt global warming is will destroy us according to the left- e liberals. <br />But with a slight temperature raise we need to be prepared. <br />One point five degree raise will change our way of life. And thats the change we need to accept as a fact upcoming. <br />The IPCC 2019 report does point out that we have to be prepared to tackle the challenges on a wide spread eco systems. We need to clean up the mess we made and be more conservative about the use of fossil fuels. Fuels we need to share with population growth world wide. We need clean air everywhere! We need clean plastic free oceans full of fish. <br />co2 we need . For sample, to make more forest ecosystems to reduce droughts and fires, we need to protect the forest we have left and make sure we forest for wood production. The same needs are there for farm land and food production. <br />The mess we made need to be attended and cleaned up.

For example how should someone predict the effects of a unprecedented effect, humans massively burning fossil fuel, without models? He is calling for informations while giving no explanation for rising temperatures himself. Climate did always change is as good as an explanation for climate change as Thor&#39;s hammer for lighting. There need to be physical reasons for rising temperatures so sceptics should come up with their models so the &quot;alarmists&quot; can match them with historical data like the sceptics do now.

There are effects that pick up speed with temperature like the Methane from permafrost. Water vapour is also a function of temperature because warmer air can keep more water vapour. <br />There are additional effects like less ice coverage resulting in a lower albedo or melting water reducing the albedo on ice.<br />He is also oversimplifying the effects of CO2 by claiming that the world is in a constant equilibrium concerning the increased energy input due to the GHE effect. Earth an especially water can store huge amounts of energy. It&#39;s comparable to turning up the radiator in a really cold room with stone walls. Even though your energy input is now much higher it takes hours until the room reaches an equilibrium.	UCpNgoIqlx95SPQB2lPjmYvQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpNgoIqlx95SPQB2lPjmYvQ	0

Arctic circle ice is floating ice (which has no effect on sea level when it melts, since ice is less dense than water and floats, displacing the same amount of water frozen as it does when melted.) The world&#39;s oceans have a rough surface area of about 360 million KM, while the volume of ice in Antarctica and Greenland combined is about 29 million cubic KM which, if it all melted today, would produce about 26 million cubic KM of water. So about 70 meters deep. But it&#39;s not GOING to melt in one day. It&#39;s not going to melt in one century. It&#39;s probably not even going to all melt in one MILLENIUM, even if the lunatics were right and the temperature is going to just keep going up.

UgwNpqGhIDHskQBAB454AaABAg.8uardaBkiqg8unw2owk6Ui		0	2019-05-11 19:56:09	Gunnar Hovmark	@Rory Forbes OK, let's look at one of the "brilliant" Mr Moore's memorable moments here: https://youtu.be/UFHX526NPbE 5:02: The petition project. To even mention that is just a waste of everybody's time. The "scientists and professionals" are people that claim that they have a B.Sc. degree or higher. Nobody checked that, and to sign the petition they didn't have to show that they really KNOW anyting about climate research. Also 31 000 signatures is not impressive if you consider that there are around a million Americans with a B.Sc. or higher who did NOT sign the petition. 5:14: Sorry, whether we like it or not we need statistics in science, so there's nothing wrong with talking about likelihoods. 6:22: What the CO2 levels have been in the past is not very relevant. The problem we're discussing now is what will happen because of the rapid INCREASE in CO2 levels. Note that the time scale is logarithmic, which makes the changes look faster the farther back in time they are. Also, while he's talking about that graph: Nobody has said that CO2 is the ONLY factor that affects global temperature. When Moore implies that climate researchers do that he's dishonest to say the least. Moore really likes that graph. If you want to know more about it you can look here, eight minutes into this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XIpTqbLR5Y . Note that I'm not saying that our old friend Potholer54 is entirely correct here, but he makes it very clear that Moore is abusing the data. 8:10: So what if it was warmer 50 million years ago? The world was very different then. There was an entirely different set of species and their habitats looked a lot different. Even the continents themselves were different. If our current world was suddenly moved into that climate we'd have a very hard time adapting to it. 9:10: Moore has picked one graph that fits his purpose particularly well, but there are plenty of similar graphs. CO2 emissions by humans started in the 19th century, so it's not impossible that the warming that can be seen from the early 1900s was caused by humans. Some ups and downs are caused by meteorological events, volcanic activity and solar activity, but the general trend that can be seen for the last hundred years agrees very well with what we know about greenhouse gases. 9:39: Note that the graph was supplied by Christopher Monckton. Not the most highly regarded name among climate scientists. Watch this to get a second opinion: https://youtu.be/LM7O-GNEcjM 9:44: Just in passing mentioning "Climategate". "Climategate" was to a great extent about that the scientists had tried to hide uncertainties in their proxy data that they couldn't fully explain. Dishonest of course. An interesting thing though is that other scientists now have got very similar results with other proxy data, so the "Climategaters" would have done a lot better if they had shown their uncertainties and presented the explanations they had, that probably were pretty good. 10:08: A local trend over nine years. Not very impressive. 10:24: This one is in fact a bit intriguing. It's local, but what are the chances that the longest record in the world doesn't show any really significant warming trend towards the end? Anyway, you can always try reading a bit more about it here: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/03/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-central-england-temperatures-help-needed-to-find-missing-data/ 11:30: Sorry, playing the Al Gore card will not help. Everybody knows he was wrong about many things. 11:44: WTF, he's talking about ice ages. The mechanisms that cause them are fairly well known, and he even explains them. Climate scientists also know pretty well that CO2 followed temperature then, and why. That's not what's happening now though. He's wasting our time again. 14:11: Increase in global biomass, yes, that's an effect we see now. There are uncertainties about what effects a further temperature increase and local changes in precipitation will have. Also, it's important to remember that CO2 fertilization is not the only factor. Better methods in agriculture and very ambitious tree planting programmes also help. 15:06: Qoutes the famous meteorologist Joni Mitchell. :D Fact is that the effects of water vapor and clouds are studied carefully. OK, it's maybe not fully understood, but rest assured that climate scientists know that they have to be taken into account. 15:28: WTF, CO2 is a toxic pollutant in submarines and other enclosed spaces, not in the concentrations that can be found in the atmosphere. He's building a straw man here, typical climate sceptic tactic. 16:49: "Ocean acidification is impossible". Depends on what you mean by acidification. The oceans are becoming less basic, and that is expected to cause problems. 17:30: Note that he says "a very short time GEOLOGICALLY". That's not a short time. The CO2 starvation is an interesting idea, but we're talking about a very long time with many uncertainties there. It's noble of him to think about life on earth tens or hundreds of thousand years from now, but it would be more relevant to think about the next few generations of humans, and the species that are threatened by extinction right now. Besides, living organisms will never be able to remove all carbon from the atmosphere because volcanic and tectonic activity will always supply some CO2. 17:57: Here he goes completely nuts. Is he reading from a pamphlet written by an oil company? 18:30: Sure, we use a lot of energy and we need to get it from somewhere. To find the best solutions we have to acknowledge that new solutions are needed. 19:15: Is he sponsored by the oil sands industry in Canada? 19:50: He SAYS he's not. 20:24: "A screeching halt". Very few people want that to happen. Again, what we need to do is to acknowledge that we have a problem, and do something sensible about it.

I'm almost completely sure we wouldn't agree on that. Hell, it really isn't brain surgery ... or even rocket science. It's orders of magnitude more complex than those subjects. There are probably fewer than two handfuls of people on the planet who understand the subject enough to speak intelligently about it. That's why there are so may people who sound like idiots ... and most of those are AGW true believers. The entire basis of the AGW argument from the alarmist point of view is the notion of unprecedented change ... caused primarily by human emissions of GHGs. This includes the big three scary effects ... unprecedented temperature rise, unprecedented sea level rise (ice melt) and ocean acidification, all caused by anthropogenic CO2 rise. Sorry, there is absolutely no evidence to support that at all ... nothing, and loads of evidence that it's simply natural variation. As for the "average skeptical science franchise" being filled with "bad science" ... well, that's simply not true. Skeptical science is the ONLY science. Warmists haven't been doing any real science since Richard Lindzen and Judith Curry left the IPCC (a completely political organization). Anyone who still believes the silliness we're being fed, under the heading of climate science, is a credulous fool.

What ticks me off is that the usual climate sceptic franchise is so full of bad science. Take your "brilliant" Patrick Moore for example. His early speeches on global warming are ridiculous. I'm sure he's a clever guy, and in a recent interview I saw he had removed the silly stuff. The effect was that he hardly talked about any aspects of global warming at all.

If the issues are loaded with angst, the prudent thing is to allay fears first, before moving on. Also, as scientists, they're reluctant to make absolute statements, but prefer to leave the doors open for new developments. Their general demeanor is to quiet irrational fears. I'm less critical of not supplying citations for information than you. I already know how to locate everything they have discussed. No single debate can or will ever provide more than a tiny view into this complex study. What annoys me are the AGW true believers who seem to believe the science has all been worked out and settled.

What I say they're saying so far is not "don't worry". They're saying we don't know how much we should worry, and that we don't know exactly what we should worry about. It's a bit of a problem with the way they approach this that they deal with one issue at a time and more or less dismiss them one by one. They may avoid showing the big picture that way. At around 29:00 Dowlatabadi is discussing stuff that the graph in the clip clearly doesn't show. He should be required to present a source there.

Surely you understand that it is not possible to be a scientist and NOT a skeptic, don't you? Anyone who is not skeptical of a group who coined the equivocal term, "climate change", should not be taken seriously. Anyone who thought he could determine the veracity of a discussion on "fast forward" can't be taken seriously either. In fact, the public presentation on "climate change" can't be taken seriously. There is simply no "consensus" among actual scientists nor does the science show what we are told it shows. Personally, after over 30 years of following this debate and at least 20 in some depth, I'm hard pressed to find any AGW true believe even somewhat rational. Certainly none of their "science" is rational. It is entirely founded on dubious models and tainted "data". The following is a debate with two of possibly the world's foremost authorities on climate science and both are skeptics, but from supposedly two sides of the debate (although it would be hard to tell). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJwayalLpYY	UCSt6Pl83bjWbmtZuz6Lg4Cg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSt6Pl83bjWbmtZuz6Lg4Cg	1	UgwNpqGhIDHskQBAB454AaABAg	Gunnar Hovmark

One after another states that there have been times in the history of the planet when the CO2 levels and global temperatures have been both higher and lower than they are today...which is true BUT the time periods that refer to pre-date man walking upright but do correspond with events like massive levels of volcanic activity, asteroid impacts or other mega-dramatic events. The times in history they use as examples of times when the atmospheric CO2 have been higher or lower they FAIL to note that the transitions from those highs to lows have taken place over tens of thousands of years meanwhile we are seeing with our own two eyes the sorts of impacts that &quot;normally&quot; take place over much longer periods of time developing in a matter of just over 100 years since the birth of the fossil fuel age. Not a single one of the &quot;rocket scientists&quot; speaks to the time frames within which the current changes are taking place and what accounts for that but instead by avoiding examining time frames in which events take place they ignore the INCONVENIENT TRUTH which is that we are seeing changes take place before our very eyes, within a single lifetime that when &quot;naturally&quot; occurring take place over tens of thousands of years in the absence of a major event such as an asteroid impact of a period majorly significant increases in volcanic activity.

Global warming would move the limit of the grain belt way up into Canada and Siberia. Greater CO2 would dramatically increase crop yields. Hunger would cease globally.<br /> CO2 levels were as much as 10 times greater in ancient times than the levels of today, yet no Armageddon occurred. Read the scientific papers of Dr. Heinz Hug to understand how CO2 functions in the atmosphere. It has very narrow bands of absorption, 1, 2.7, 4.3, 15 micrometers are the generalized spectral peaks. These wavelengths are ALL absorbed to extinction within 30 feet of the ground. ADDING MORE CO2 DOES NOT INCREASE ENERGY ABSORPTION, but only reduces the distance needed for full absorption by a foot or two, in fact, higher CO2 levels caused higher O and O2 levels (photosynthesis) that allowed the dinosaurs to exist (Commercial green houses inject CO2 to increase plant yields). The atmosphere today has .04% CO2, yet modern nuclear submarines operate with levels of .2% or higher with no ill effects to the crew. Higher CO2 also reduces the amount of water vapor venting required from plants. When plants draw in air through its Stomata (tiny holes) to eat the CO2, it must vent water vapor to keep from drying out. If there is twice as much CO2 in the air, the plant only needs half as many Stomata, and thus uses half as much water. The deserts are greening today where the CO2 is rising for this reason. Also, with low CO2, plants must breath in oxygen to replace it. They generate hydrogen peroxide and other damaging molecules that the plant must expend water and energy to remove. Remember that In ancient times, the times with the most vegetation and O and O2, CO2 was as much as 10 times higher than today. We are currently in a CO2 drought, see the You Tube video &quot;World in Midst of Carbon Drought (w/Prof. William Happer, Princeton University)&quot;.<br /><br />As an example, during the Cretaceous period, there was NO ice at all at the poles, much higher CO2, and the Earth was full of vegetation and dinosaurs. They could not live today as the O and O2 levels are too low for such large land animals. <br /><br />The oceans are rising today because the Wisconsinin ice age has not yet finished, there is still ice at the poles and it is still melting. The ice age ends when all the ice has melted, so technically were are still in the last ice age, but the next ice age will begin before the last has ended. <br /><br />The climate changes we have seen in the geologic record are entirely disconnected from the CO2 levels. CO2 is a VERY minor gas in the atmosphere (.04%). Note that water vapor is a vastly more efficient and abundant greenhouse gas (1% to 4.24%) than CO2. The reason for climate change is entirely due to the output of the sun and the amount of cosmic rays striking the atmosphere. Watch the You Tube video &quot;Svensmark: the cloud mystery&quot; and maybe read his book &quot;The chilling stars&quot; to understand the reasons for climate change, it has NOTHING to do with CO2.<br /><br />After doing these things, look on the US Geologic Survey website and find the graphs of Earth temperatures over the last 2 million years. This time period includes all the recent ice ages. You will see that this data proves we are leaving the current interglacial warm period and are entering the next ice age. <br /><br />The fraud of anthropogenic global warming exists because the globalists are subsidizing it to convince us to accept a global carbon tax, that is to get western nations to accept it. There is no call for China, the greatest producer of CO2 in history, to pay such a tax. ONLY the west. This tax will in effect take money from poor people in rich countries and give it to rich people in poor countries.<br /><br />Don&#39;t fall for this fraud. AGW is the greatest science scam ever thrust upon the people of the Earth in all of history. Don&#39;t buy it, educate yourself instead.<br /><br />As a final note, read about the Vostok ice core samples, and other following sample sets to see that ice ages are preceded by a brief warming period. We are leaving that stage now. Real scientists expect a little ice age to happen, starting as early as 2020, and that it will last 350-400 years. Be ready.

The trouble with this video is these guys don‚Äôt have the monopoly on questioning the models. The IPCC projections are based on models that are being continuously reviewed and improved. The consensus of all involved academics is that human activity is responsible for an increase in CO2 in the Earths atmosphere and this will have a warming effect.<br />It is a fact that sea levels are rising, ice cover in the Northern hemisphere is decreasing and global temperatures are on the increase. We could bet on the the best models available being wrong and we could wait 50 years for the data but who in there right mind is going to back these guys above a far greater number equally qualified academics.

Several hypotheses occur to me, but they are usually countered by the obvious economic and political dominance of the fossil fuel industry, which gets wars and interventions approved by both political parties (in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Venezuela, etc.), not to mention bipartisan congressional approval of pipeline and drilling/fracking expansion. Is this a &quot;technology&quot; thing, to justify job creation in fields like wind and solar generation, or energy storage, or &quot;safe&quot; nuclear?

All of the inaccuracies are accounted for and are almost always included in estimates. For example, in the link I included, you can see the abstracts include numbers and give the margin of error. In fact one acknowledged the error margin is so big it overlaps their estimates on the rise itself in some cases. So clearly this is an incredibly difficult measurement to make. But there is undoubtedly a rise. Melting water is going to make the oceans rise. There is a paper where they measure the gravitational pull of a glacier and by checking every year, are able to measure the loss of mass. So a rise is just inevitable. Question is, how much? Not there impact is already being felt. The insurance companies have already noticed, and coastal property rates are going up faster than the rest of the industry. If that doesn't prove something is happening, nothing will! üòÅ	UCSmaXtP5ooCiLnS3VqHV50A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSmaXtP5ooCiLnS3VqHV50A	1	UgwvhxH3eypb-XnwU514AaABAg	bosco008

He also talked about the problems associated with each measurement method and how each method is producing different values for sea level rise. He also showed a correlation between sunspot activity and sea level rise. His explanation seemed to be not that sunspot activity is actually causing sea levels to rise, but that its expanding the atmosphere and causing satellite measurements to be even more inaccurate (and they already had other limitations). And Doiron seems to be saying that green house gasses do effect climate, but that they would need to be in far higher concentrations to have the type of impact that people are claiming. He also seems to be saying that other climate models are not properly integrating the gradual increase in GHG over time and they are not factoring in how the Earth filters out much of the CO2 that is pumped into the air. Honestly though, without studying the science yourself for years, its hard to know how accurate what they're saying is. I am getting the feel that the global warming claims have been exaggerated though.

Are you REALLY so dim, that you cannot fathom its bluntly accurate explanation? Do you not know know what "technology" means? Or are you incapable of what effort was necessary to achieve the Moon landings in the first place, and how silly it would be to attempt to rebuild a program when some companies and parts no longer exist and the ones that do are mostly outdated? And because this basic knowledge is well within the understandings of a grade schooler, yet somehow eludes YOU, you claim it to be some sort of satanic plot? Well, other than the possibility that Satan had something to do with your metal deficiencies, there is no evidence to support that ludicrous statement.

It‚Äôs just something for a mechanical engineer to hand wave. <br />Also, no one negates that that photosynthesis removes a large part of the CO2 every year. No one has claimed that humans can be blamed for all or even most of the CO2. But evidently we produce just enough to bring the system out of balance, at a rate of about 3ppm per year, namely a little more than to have an average balance. Thats only a problem because nature canÀãt adjust fast enough. The rate of increase in recent years was above 3 ppm per year, that‚Äôs still almost 1 percent. So what‚Äôs the point of complaining about models being unrealistic, which are making predictions based on an annual 1 percent increase? Also, the modeling is in reality carried out with varying the parameters around their most likely expectations to create a fuller picture, and to estimate sensitivities. <br /><br />The good old retired astronaut with his ‚Äûcorrelation isn‚Äôt causation‚Äú joke of the correlation between ufo sighting and ocean temperatures makes me chuckle but he shoots himself in the foot. He wants to ignore that the GHG mechanism is proven on first principle and by experiments, and it‚Äôs a shame that he as physicist puts forward such disingenuous bullshit. He disproves nothing with just mocking. He can‚Äôt be taken serious.	UCvUb3mfL9xrhnVJZmoxTMyg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvUb3mfL9xrhnVJZmoxTMyg	0

If you buy a scientist he&#39;s gonna tell you what you want for funding and above average wages (scientist generally dn&#39;t get the great salaries that people would imagine, they just aint rockstars. But you do get ethical moral people, scientist too of course, who are the majority, even amongst scientists, who will come forward with the correct info/data. The globalist loonies though wont give these guys the airtime, the coverage to inform the masses, it simply goes against their agenda, after all &quot;why let facts get in the way of a good story&quot;. Journalism too is suffering the same fate; Big multinationals paying their wages. Again , the small % of journalists that carry the agenda are the only ones that get the airtime. The reason you would have always thought &quot;the world is not as it seems&quot; deep down, is because it isnt and you watch too much tv and tv news. Rockefeeler once asked a question: How much of the media would you have to control to sway public opinion? The answer was around 25%.

The eruptions also have caused acid rains when the aerosols washed out of the atmosphere. Then we have the geological issues of what and where initiated this massive volcanic event. The traps would had been the largest super-volcano ever on earth as the basalt left from the lava pools indicate more than a quarter of norther Siberia. The latest hypothesis is the earth was hit by an asteroid in Antarctica (then part of Pangaea) which would had been on the opposite side of the Earth in the Permian period, which forced the mantle to fracture the crust on the complete opposite side. This comes from the discovery of a crater 300km and 850 meters deep they've discovered under the ice which indicates an impact from an object 40km wide. https://phys.org/news/2006-06-largest-killer-crater-ice-antarctica.html I am an advocate for climate science, however I do agree the models are faulty and I've yet to find two researchers replicate each other's hypothesis.

UgwnTlmLLBQn1BobQJJ4AaABAg	1	2	2019-03-27 04:39:23	R Slicker	I am not a climate scientist, however, I do have considerable experience with computer modelling, and I have absolutely 0% confidence in the ability of ANYONE to accurately predict climate change due to 1) the significant number of climate variables involved, 2) the current scientific understanding of those variables, 3) the current scientific understanding of the interrelationship of those variables and their effect of climate change, and 4) the impossibility of model validation within highly variable climate norms. With a solid understanding of all of the above, the level of confidence in a model prediction would be minimal at best, because it cannot be scientifically tested. Without a solid understanding of all of the above, the level of confidence in a model prediction would be NIL. <br /><br />For example, the Canadian Press recently ran an article, &quot;Big U-turn: Key melting Greenland glacier is growing again&quot;, (MARCH 2019 You Tube) wherein a NASA &#39;climate scientist&#39;, Josh Willis conceded that &quot;ocean temperature is a bigger player in glacier retreats and advances than previously thought&quot;. <br /><br />As a modeller, if you don&#39;t have an accurate understanding of the impact of ocean temperature on arctic ice, how can you possibly create a model that will deliver an accurate prediction of climate change. Moreover, what about the other hundreds of variables and their interrelationships with &#39;ocean temperature&#39; and &#39;arctic ice&#39;? They would all be inaccurate now! <br /><br />Very interestingly, even though Josh conceded that he misunderstood the interrelationship between this ONE variable and arctic ice, it did not stop him from doubling down on his prediction WITHOUT ANY FURTHER STUDY, ANALYSIS, OR EVEN MODEL RECALIBRATION! <br /><br />In the most basic model, if one variable is improperly considered, the whole model is rubbish, and your predictions are worthless!

A frenzy that is making Politicians form knee jerk reactions for political popularity built through stupidity. The youth of today are less intelligent than those of my day and will rally to any populous fad or fake news. They need to understand that the world regardless of their vitriol will end! Climate has nothing to do with it. The reason, the sun will die ‚Äî life on earth whether tomorrow or 1000 years or 100000 years or 5 billion years will end. The current scientific thought is that the Earth has some 5 billion years left. People need to understand that the lifespan and exsistance of life on the earth are wholly dependent upon the ageing of the sun. Scientifically in about 5 billion years from now, the sun is going to reach a point where its core can no longer sustain the nuclear fusion as it has been and it will evolve into a red giant. A red giant star is a dying star in the last stages of stellar evolution. Therefore, that means the sun could grow large enough to engulf the earth as well as our nearby planets, but even if it doesn&#39;t, life will still cease to exist on earth at some point during the sun&#39;s transformation into a red giant. Monies spent on climate paranoia would be better fed into interstellar travel. There endeth the lesson.	UCIN5Pagax0pSjIUHjjnOqZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIN5Pagax0pSjIUHjjnOqZQ	0

There were 11,944 climate papers written by 29,083 authors. Most papers took no position. An obviously biased group called &quot;Rebutting Global Warming Misinformation&quot; cherry-picked 8,547 and contacted them to get a favorable statement. Only 1,189 bothered to respond (which is 4% of the original 29,083). 97% agreed that there might be global warming caused by man. This is THEIR &quot;97%&quot;.<br />They KNOW the &quot;97%&quot; is a lie....but it&#39;s all they&#39;ve got.<br /><del>---------SOMEONE NEEDS TO SAY-------------</del><br />1--when you can PROVE that there is Gore-Bull warming...trending upward for 30 years straight (30 is the difference between &quot;weather&quot; and &quot;climate&quot;) (since the theory is that CO2 forces temperatures to rise...and CO2 IS increasing... if 1 year doesn&#39;t increase...the theory dies) with RAW DATA and....<br />2--if you can PROVE it&#39;s due ONLY to CO@ and not 1 of 100 other possible causes and...<br />3--when you can PROVE it&#39;s ONLY man-made CO2 (we can&#39;t control natural sources)...<br />y&#39;all get back to us....capiche?<br />Until that day is here.....STFU.<br />BTW: if not THE coldest, one of the coldest decades IN THE LAST 8,000 YEARS was the 1870&#39;s.

Here, from 2015: "To make its maps, the Public Press partnered with the University of California-Berkeley Cartography and Geographic Information System Education Lab and used flooding and sea level projections from the US Geological Survey and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission predicts that in the next hundred years, water levels in the Bay could rise as much as 8 feet over high tide at current levels, including storm surge." Got that little detail, "the University of California-Berkeley Cartography and Geographic Information System Education Lab along with the US Geological Survey predict, *in the next 100 years.* Not tomorrow. Not next month. The next century. And please, note the sources. As of October 2018, Berkeley alumni, faculty members and researchers include 107 Nobel laureates, 25 Turing Award winners, and 14 Fields Medalists. They have also won 9 Wolf Prizes, 45 MacArthur Fellowships,[13] 20 Academy Awards, 19 Pulitzer Prizes, and 207 Olympic medals. These are not "cranky old men". But you won't tell me, what drives you?

The petition is a website called the Global Warming Petition Project. However, the only requirement to be listed in this petition is an undergraduate degree in any kind of science. According to the US Department of Education, over 10 million people earned a science degree between 1971 and 2008. So while 31,000 people signed this petition, that‚Äôs actually only 0.3% of Americans with science degrees. And most importantly, only 0.1% of those 31,000 are climate scientists. So the claim that the Global Warming Petition Project disproves the scientific consensus is a myth that uses the technique of 'magnified minority'. Look at this comment as a wee bonus. No charge.

Even among books it is very rare for _the title_ to contain a comprehensive argument. "Jim", for instance, is completely devoid of empirical observation. You, on the other hand, mention; nonsense shovels, cancer, cigarettes, lies, and unspecified financial corruption. (And do not address any of the arguments presented). I honestly have no idea what to make of these charts and graphs and very old cranky men. But when I see one side of a dispute holding up a giant sign that reads "My position relies on insults and handwaving! and I don't like to make objective comparisons!" -I tend to throw my lot in with the other side.

He is, in fact, the Director of EOG, a gas and oil company formerly known as Enron. He is also the spokesperson for a fossil-fuel advocacy group called Plants need CO2, whose advertisements have been shown frequently throughout Montana. On June 9, 2010, he provided the citizens of Billings and the students of MSU Billings with a presentation sponsored by the Montana Petroleum Association, the Montana Chamber of Commerce and Big Sky Economic Development called Our atmosphere needs more CO2. For your inspection, his basic message can be found in the 2010 issue of the Montana Treasure State Journal, the official publication of the Montana Petroleum Association, pages 28-32.

I see. I'd like a link to them, just for balance!! Leighton Steward, is a 77-year-old former oil and gas executive. His website, "co2isgreen", also has an extensive history of receiving fossil fuel industry funding. As to the "errors in their arguments": The accuracy of the global surface temperature record has been confirmed by many different studies using a variety of different approaches, including by natural thermometers and satellites. There is very little difference between the results of different groups analyzing the surface temperature data, Ocean measurements also show an immense amount of heat accumulation in the world's oceans, well outside the margin of error .

That only works if the slope of the land is 45 degrees. Florida is flat, very low and with permeable rock. You can't build a dyke or levy when the rock is permeable. And of course it is not just Florida. Also there is no reason to think we will go back to the 1800s. In many areas around the world there is grid parity for renewable sources. It is cheaper to use renewables. So you get richer. Seems that is the only thing you are concerned about. Why else the concern about carbon tax?

We literally used oil to bring us from the dirty 1800s to the modern-day cleanliness. Since environmental wackos insist on regulating the one thing better than oil (nuclear) into economic infeasibility, we're stuck moving backwards by moving off oil with freaking windmills, solar and hydroelectric dam building (which will NEVER supply all our electricity and have quite a large harmful footprint to the natural environment compared to oil). I'm all for supplanting oil with something better (ie nuclear), but carbon taxes are ridiculous. If we have to put ourselves back in the 1800s just so that the Florida coastline doesn't move back a few dozen feet in the next 200 years, I'm sorry it's not worth it. Those buildings will all be destroyed long before that time because of other reasons.

Over the past billion years the have been higher most of the time. Temperature was also much higher. But our civilisation is currently build around current shorelines and can handle current weather patterns. Sea level has varied by more than 100 meters. So we won't suddenly become like Mars. The question is: is it intelligent to cause damage knowing that it is more economical to prevent it? If your grand children were living in Florida in an area that could be flooded as sea level rises, I would not want to be contributing to the loss of their property. Or any other negative consequences. Besides that there are many other good reasons to stop fossil fuel use.

Most people think those things are consistent but that is far from the truth. It takes thousands of years for an orbital distance to repeat. The other 1 percent are caused by the growth of plants which is determined by the orbit of the sun, sun spots, the moons tidal forces, soil quality and geology.

I am not 100% convinced yet that we did not cause our current climate problem. Here&#39;s why:<br /><br /> Mankind does have the power to alter our environment/climate. Just look at how much of the amazon rainforest¬†we have cut down. We need to focus more on the worlds deforestation problem. Nobody talks about it anymore. <br /><br /> The ozone hole is no longer a problem because the international community took steps to ban certain chemicals from being released into the atmosphere.<br /><br /> If the scientists in this video are 100% correct that its just paranoid people talking about manmade climate change, then there really isn&#39;t anything to worry about. But we still should wean ourselves off of oil and coal. Just not rapidly.	UChLZlq78O8idIUNP5COpUdg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChLZlq78O8idIUNP5COpUdg	0

And how is that explanation better than the one where it is because we banned the substances? You have said nothing substantial about this, at best declared ignorance. So the danger is about two things. Where is the hole in the ozone layer? Where you live? Alarmism is about what is going to happen if things are not dealt with. Things were dealt with, hence we all didn't die of cancer. This you must understand right? Example: We are driving to fast, we won't be able to take that curve! Driver slows down and doesn't crash in the curve. OMG the alarmism, we took the curve, you were exaggerating when you said we were going to crash! You have seen it as nonsense because that is how you interpret it. It doesn't mean it actually is nonsense. I have lived enough to see another kind of nonsense. The one you are spouting. I mean, it is just one bin of all the crazies with flat earthers, anti vaxxers etc. Acid rain is a thing and I am sure you have exaggerated Carters statement. I mean, there is no way you have made a 100% accurate representation of his position, and there is no way you have underplayed it. So what did he exactly say? I mean, acid rain is a thing and it is bad for nature. Again, since we have reduced the cause of it we have reduced the problem and danger. This really can't be that surprising to you? 1. Problem identified. 2. Problem informed about. 3. Problem dealt with. 4. No problem anymore. The way you are arguing, you will always come to the conclusion that it was a hoax no matter if it got solved or was an actual hoax. That is just lazy, stupid or dishonest.

Check back in another thirty years and I bet there will still be no improvement. Another thing to note. We've been living with this hole in the ozone for thirty years now and we haven't all died of skin cancer like they were screaming we would back then. That's the thing... I've been around long enough to have seen this nonsense repeatedly. I was there when Jimmy Carter warned us acid rain was going to melt the skin off our bones. Didn't happen. I lived through all the celebrities preaching about the hole in the ozone that was going to give us all cancer. Didn't happen. Now I get to hear it all again with global warming. Won't happen.

The treaty went into effect 2 years later, for starters. At that point, all products already existing at that point will continue to emit during their life time right? Totally consistent with the data if you actually start to think a bit. I am asking according to you, since it is about interpreting the data and that is not objective if you use the words you use. Also, "fix" is highly subjective, hence why I ask exactly what you mean. I am not confused by the data, I am confused by how you interpret it as you use inaccurate language. You say we should have seen some improvement by now. Exactly how much I ask? How do you know we are not emitting other things that hurt the layer? That keeps it stable since we have stopped emitting most of it? The data that backs up the idea that the treaty had any effect is way stronger than your insane theory that things just happened to turn out the way they did. Ludicrous. I mean, we know you are really uninformed as you initially said that they don't even monitor it anymore. Don't forget that. You were totally WRONG and not an authority on the subject. Be humble. It is way more likely that a guy in a lab cote is right than a guy on the internet. I mean, guys in lab coats can conduct tests, that proves what is hurtful to ozone. Your theories have absolutely no basis in science. "The very fact the hole hasn't changed since they were banned proves CFCs weren't the problem." This is ludicrous speculation. My claim that the fact that the ozone layer has been stable since we banned the hurtful substances proves that the ban was effective is in every way of measuring a better argument. You really are grasping at straws here in order to try to discredit science as an enterprise.

That's not according to me, that's just a matter of historical fact. None of that stuff is according to me, it all comes straight from the page you provided the link for. The hole appeared in the late '70s/early '80s, shot quickly up to around 20 million square kilometers in size, and has more or less been there since. As of 2018 it was bigger than it was in 1987. There have been a few dips and spikes, but it has generally been in the low 20s since 1980 or so. Again, not according to me, according to the site you provided. I don't understand the confusion when you provided the information. No, it won't take a billion years to fix itself. It doesn't take a billion years for anything in the atmosphere to change. Even a massive volcanic eruption that sends all sorts of aerosols into the upper atmosphere is cleared up in a matter of years or decades. If the cause of the hole had been removed we should see at least some sign of shrinkage after thirty years. Just because somebody in a lab coat says something doesn't mean it's true. We have a list of failed theories dating back to the beginning of science; phlogiston, phrenology, luminiferous aether, AGW, etc. The fact some group of activists campaigned to get CFCs banned because they claimed they were destroying the ozone doesn't mean the ozone hole is man-made. The very fact the hole hasn't changed since they were banned proves CFCs weren't the problem. Fun fact, "fossil fuel" is not a scientific term. There is no accepted, proven theory for the origin of hydrocarbon fuels. The fact that such fuels exist in places that have never had life (most famously Saturn's moon, Titan) points to an abiotic origin. For all we know, hydrocarbon fuels are constantly renewed deep within the Earth and worrying about running out is like worrying about running out of magma if we don't plug up all the volcanoes.

It is not something that happens one day, it is a gradual process. You said it is larger now than 30 years ago but was stable since before the fix. When was the fix according to you? From which year was it stable according to you? When was the fix implemented according to you? That it should take 30 years for a natural process to heal is something you just think. It has no scientific backing what so ever. It might as well take 10 million years to heal, you have no idea what so ever. It could take 1 year as well, you have no idea. You know what? It could be a billion years. How would you know how long it should take? Well, it could be. But we know better. We have studied things. That is why we have science, to figure out things instead of relying on guesses that doesn't produce the immense wealth we enjoy in the modern world. Sadly sometimes there is a downside. Fossil fuels are amazing when it comes to providing us with energy, and has led to indescribable prosperity, but that doesn't change the fact that the Earth can get measurable warmer by the emissions from burning it :(. I wish it wasn't true, believe me. I enjoy spending energy and would love nothing less than to continue spending that energy.

If you take away the cause of damage the system that built the ozone layer in the first place should rebuild it over time. Even if it takes a fair amount of time I would expect to see a general tendency towards shrinkage over the course of thirty years. Again, assuming that whatever caused the hole was removed. For all we know, the hole is some natural phenomenon akin to the red spot on Jupiter.

As it has been roughly the same for like 25 years or so, are you really surprised the media doesn't really talk about it? "by 1996 most developed countries had banned the production of nearly all Freons" Isn't it interesting that the ozone layer got stable from that point on? I don't think you have a fair take on this dude. Just because something has stopped getting worse doesn't mean it will get better. It just means it will stay the same, as it has.

Did you ever notice that we stopped hearing about the ozone hole literally the day after the relevant legislation was passed? We didn't get years of follow-up reports tracking the size of the hole to see if the legislation did anything. For the first time in human history all governments around the world got together, agreed on something, enacted legislation to fix a problem, and were right about it. Amazing. Either that or it was a fear-mongering campaign meant to get rid of CFCs and it didn't need to continue after CFCs were banned. Why do we need to wean ourselves off oil and coal? Pumping more CO2 into the atmosphere won't hurt us, won't hurt the climate, and will help plants.

It is nice to have a rational conversation, something that seems to go missing when the 2 sides meet on this issue, i would say that i have done a fair amount of research but dont consider myself to much more informed than i was 5 - 10 years ago mainly because of how hard it seems to be to sort the information from the hysteria (on both sides) and ultimately whatever conclusion i come up with will not help or hinder the issue, It might help me not buy a beachfront property if i find out that it is going to lose half its land to sea level changes, or buy an outback hobby farm in my retirement (may it come soon) if there is going to be prevailing drought .

I would however be a bit surprised as I don't see skeptics mention it a lot (can't recall a single time), and it would be something good for them to say if it was the case. I mean, I have to assume that the skeptics use the best arguments they can right? Well, at least if you try to find the smarter people. Obviously there will be morons spouting nonsense about anything :P. Ultimately we probably think very much alike I would think, but just have a different impression of how accurate the old models have been. I can't say that I have done that much research into the subject though, it is more based on me constantly seeing the models being unfairly judged. That of course based on how I think the validity of a model should be judged, based on my own knowledge of science and modelling. Either way, given how big the question is, it is scary how ill informed most of us are. Especially if you think about how interesting the question really is. I for sure consider myself not really that informed. But I have probably heard Bill Nye say "it is true" like, over a hundred times :P.

I can only assume that with so much being made of the sunspot cycle by the more sceptical community that when the cycle returns to a less active part of its ebb and flow that temperatures will also reverse and follow that, maybe (well definitely) somebody with the data on that should use it to make a prediction about the next 5-10-50+ years instead of just telling the other side that they got it wrong. I totally agree with you there..That is really where i am at in this whole debate, still looking for somebody to get it right. I have already seen the cost of our politicians listening to bad information..

Past predictions are commonly misrepresented, like leaving the first part out of "if A happens, B will happen". If I skeptic with a hidden agenda says "well the models predicted B, which didn't happen", he essentially lies because if A actually did not happen, the models didn't predict B to happen. So why an old model might not be very accurate could be because they predicted a higher concentration of CO2 for instance. So the models have to do two things, know the mechanisms of temperature AND predict an unpredictable future. And while it is very reasonable to be ware about the accuracy of the mainstream climate scientists models, we don't even have any models by the skeptics to judge. Why don't they put their skills to the test and predict the future average temperature? Surely, that has to be the absolutely most efficient way to show the world they do know more. By actually making better predictions. But where are these predictions?	UCLOAOWd_DST10sd3YX42h-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLOAOWd_DST10sd3YX42h-A	1	UgxAvzkrlA5aBHXOZ_54AaABAg	Jeremy Thompson

If i had never seen a plane before and some scientist said " trust me it will fly" i think i might take the train anyway and get the plane back with him once i met him at our destination.. When a doctor Prescribes me anything, i will go and find out as much as much about that product/drug as i can, if i can see the data from original trials i will. I agree that predictions are getting more accurate but early predictions were wildly wrong. There are quite a few things that do not make sense to me, the fact that the AGW side ( i hate using the term " side" it suggests to many bad things ) has rolled out so many spin doctors, many of whom are not even scientists to convince us that they are right, here in Australia we had Tim Flannery who made so many wild claims that our state and federal governments took as fact that many costly mistakes were made. i think that when science is good it does not need a spin doctor it tends to get things so right that it becomes irrefutable. Im not saying that having a spin doctor makes it wrong but it definitely makes me question the motives and makes me search for more information, Again i am not saying that all the answers are in this video but i am not going to dismiss the information here because it is on the " wrong side" ..... still searching	UChw1B2EyeaYapcCFfA6M3wQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChw1B2EyeaYapcCFfA6M3wQ	1	UgxAvzkrlA5aBHXOZ_54AaABAg	Jeremy Thompson

Regarding AGW there are two things to consider, both all the available data and the conclusion that can be drawn from that data. If one accepts that the data is valid, it is possible to evaluate the conclusions by looking at old global mean temperature predictions for the future, because this you can check. The main stream climate scientists hasn't made perfect predictions for sure, but they are getting better with time. Why I think they know more than the skeptics is because I have yet to see the skeptics make a global mean temperature model that has had better predictive power that those of the mainstream climate scientists. Predicting the future for our own benefit is what science is all about. My thinking is that if the skeptics claim to know more about climate, they ought to make better predictions. So the only reasonable thing to question is the validity of the data itself, and honestly I am not sure how I can do anything than to in a philosophical sense appeal to authority on that. I mean, that is what we have to do no matter what position we take. Either you gather the data yourself, or you are trusting someone's or a group of peoples words. For everything else when it comes to science, I put my trust in the scientific enterprise. I do it when I go to the doctor, I do it when I buy my food, I do it when I fly, I do it when I enter a building etc. So why shouldn't I do it when it comes to climate science? Science isn't perfect, but when it comes to knowing things nothing does it better. The best player in the world will not always have the best performance, but I am not going to start choosing a worse player just because the best player wasn't the best performer every single time.

It is complicated, it requires training and dedication and a deep respect for the &#39;method.&#39; In public speaking, all the hesitation and corrections, the asides are fascinating and forgiveable within the inner circle however as the modern hysteria concerning AGW indicates that is not working. Of course politics (the passage of any idea through a community) is the real game and as that will be true in all human societies. Therefore. Science needs to address their public voice. It needs a body of public speakers who are good at it while still having those attributes above. I would suggest a world-wide organisation that maintains also a website where links to all good science is available and non-appearance, pseudoscience or red-flagged papers can be identified. I honestly believe this is vital.	UC6Nr0c3RCPLLDepR4e7vVkw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Nr0c3RCPLLDepR4e7vVkw	0

Why should I just belive these old men and scrap the findings of most other climate scientists? When youre allowed to precent your own data in an aparent logical order and unchallanged, it usually make some sort of sence to the spectator. And it can be pretty convincing, if what you&#39;re presented actually fits into your agenda. The NASA scientists are basically saying there&#39;s nothing to worry about, and we dont have to change our way of living. Thats what I like to hear. Scientists are in general very good at changing thier perception of a topic if convinsing evidence are precented. Why does this not apply to climate scientists? Besides, there&#39;s more to the picture than just temperature and sea level rise. Acidification of the oceans, coral bleaching. If we ruin our eco systems, and there by the ability to sustain a decent life on earth, it really doesn&#39;t matter if we drown. SO debate please. Lets hear both sides in the same &quot;show&quot;.

UgxEMgaJ4AnWBYkwVvh4AaABAg	0	1	2018-12-29 16:56:41	C B	It is kind of funny how the truth is coming out in the end. But unlike most of the other enviromental hysterias, the political class has banked a fuckton on global warming. It&#39;s entertaining to see how quickly they resorted to shaming skeptics while simultaneously claiming to be the True Scientists (amen). If you&#39;re on the side that&#39;s trying to censor the dissent, if you&#39;re on the side that considers debate on the topic at all totally unacceptable, if you&#39;re on the side that makes constant appeals to emotion and authority rather than focus on the data that actually led to your conclusion, if you&#39;re on the side that considers believing your conclusions not just factually based but a moral imperative without which one is a stooge or a psychopath who wants the world to burn - you&#39;re on a side that in a very real way despises the scientific method and seem to be doing everything possible to move away from the methods that allow us to genuinely find truth. That should be obvious to anybody by now, and thankfully that does seem to be becoming more clear to more people. It&#39;s hard not to say global warming is political when we hear about it almost exclusively from the most ardently political actors in our culture. The switch from &quot;global warming&quot; to &quot;climate change&quot; should have been proof enough that the alarmists have always been involved in the business of unfalsifiable theories and of choosing a conclusion first and then creating models that support that conclusion. It&#39;s totally antithetical to what we understand as science, and it&#39;s a method that has always misled us from reality. It&#39;s really pretty amazing that these alarmists seem to not think that this reality holds true for them or for global warming. It&#39;s why I don&#39;t see the notion that they are religious zealots as exaggeration - they simply had so much faith in the Truth of global warming that they were willing to use science they must have known was bad, methods they must have known are ineffective, just to be sure they could have some sort of justification for their religious conclusion. <br /><br />It&#39;s an anti-capitalist thing, pure and simple. Global warming as an idea is very effective at affording governments vastly more control over the economy, which they obviously want and will create hoaxes and entire institutions to obtain. These people talk about nationalizing the energy industry... If that&#39;s not proof I don&#39;t know what is, and if you remain unskeptical of warming claims when we can clearly see how much the state has to gain with them, then you&#39;re really hardcore indoctrinated IMO.

My much older sister insisted that boiling water froze faster than cold water because of chemical changes in hot water. <br />I believed her.<br />I tried it.<br />The water must have evaporated before freezing and the area was dry in the morning.<br />I told my oldest brother what happened and after laughing like hell, he said to get the water as cold as possible before pouring it out. I used big buckets, let them get a skin of ice on the top then poured them on the concrete slab,<br />The next morning I had a beautiful ice patch to slip and slide around on.<br />If I hadn&#39;t had a chance to try for myself then I might have believed ( for awhile anyways) that hot water froze faster than cold.<br /><br />Maybe deception is indeed the reason why the IPCC doesn&#39;t allow access to their model&#39;s formulas to be tested.<br /><br />In hindsight I wonder if my sister was confused by the trick of throwing up a cup of boiling water into the sub zero air when the steam quickly freezes...

After reading about this i recreated it easily enough in my own freezer, having best results with water at around 65C and around 25C in standard ice cube trays. Apparently the effect was named after an African student (sorry i do not remember which country) who rushed to get his ice cream in a freezer before his other classmates and saw that his froze before theirs did even though he had not let his cool down before freezing. A lot of people also confuse the trick you described as the mpemba effect.. As far as i know there is not yet a definitive answer for exactly why this happens(i may be wrong there also) but there are a few competing theories. Im sure your Sister meant well.

They are an &quot;intergovernmental&quot; panel of UN bureaucrats, who are not scientists, who represent NO GOVERNMENTS, but who claim to be experts on &quot;Climate Change:&quot; THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE TRYING TO DEFAUD countries in the world, especially the wealthy ones like the United States, into believing that the CO2 concentrations are increasing, and that catastrophic changes in sea level will result from this warming, and that within a century, coastal cities will be inundated! A-B-S-U-R-D.<br /><br />SO, what they really want is to charge wealthy countries TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CARBON &quot;CREDITS.&quot; Al Gore is investing in companies benefiting from trading carbon credits, and if a Cap &amp; Trade Carbon Credit system is implemented in the USA, it will destroy our country, as President Trump well knows. The California Democratic Legislature has implemented &quot;Cap &amp; Trade,&quot; and is rapidly driving the entire State into utter bankruptcy. I believe their State is on the brink of economic failure, which Obama wanted to imposeon the United States as a whole.

This means that only 1 in 10,000 theories presented actually survive the onslaught of science disproving the theory given enough time/tests. Unlike a proof in mathematics, theories can NOT be proven but must survive science proving the theory wrong; that is what science is for, to disprove, not prove.

I was referring to what people pushing the idiotic narrative have said. The earths climate has always been changing. At times very drastic and this will continue to happen after humans are long gone. This all comes down to money. Many of the most outspoken people on climate change have 10√ó the carbon footprint then anyone else. If it was so dire why not practice what they preach? Private jets, planes, very large homes etc. They know it's bullshit and they use it to gain power and money. Morons just get used as pawns. You know what's much worse then global warming? Global cooling. Climate will never go unchanged regardless of what humans do or don't do. The biggest mistake we can make it to try and control the uncontrollable and make things far worse. Since the 70s and 80s people have said we have 10 to 12 years to make changes or this or that will happen. Places should be 5 to 10 feet or more underwater by now. What do climate scientists that push the narrative that we are all going to die in 12 years have in common ? Government funding with the exception of a few. Why don't they talk about the ice growing at Antarctica? Also Storms haven't gotten worse. The climate has always gone back and forth and will always continue to do so.

Oceans have been raising to. If it was at the rate some say Florida would be completely under by now. These same clams have been made for decades. It's been part of the earth's cycle for millions of years. Storms aren't bigger then they have been in the past. All it takes is a little of your know research on past storms through history and remembering recorded history is just a tiny fraction of earth's time. You can go back over 100 years and see big storms. Less people die from weather events then ever before. Fact is we have billions of more people on the planet now. I'd never say climate isn't changing. It always has and always will regardless of what we do. Would you rather the planet go into another ice age? That would kill more by far. Nothing goes unchanged in the cycle of earth. Stop getting all your information from bias sources. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions instead of being a pawn. The green new deal is more about social justice then saving the planet or the people on it. If the whole planet was getting warmer by the way. Then way is ice going on Antarctic? I'm not saying take my word. I'm telling you to come to you own conclusions based off your own research and facts. Not others that wish to profit from people who can't think for themselves. If you want to be a lazy fool and be a pawn that's on you.	UCiErYXStil58q54YUPrAoLQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiErYXStil58q54YUPrAoLQ	1	UgwA1RFNt1no5I6R86F4AaABAg	Ron Preece

If people actually believed this bullshit real estate would be at a all time low in the coastal areas of the United States because no sane person would spend money developing in these areas. The cost keeps sky rocketing up in price and people keep moving to these areas not away. Which people should if it's going to be underwater soon. Morons like you have been saying the world is going to end in 12 years for the last 40+ years. Anyone my age or old most knows this as fact. Scientific evidence is only as good as the information being used for said data you idiot. There was scientific consensus the earth was flat at one time to moron. Just like we have low IQ idiot's that believe the world is still flat we will also continue to have people like you. I'm going to try and stay out of the conversation because you can't reason with stupid people like you. People like the roofer and I would make a ton more money if climate change was real for obvious reasons. You want to feel real climate change go on a flat roof on a hot day or in an attic on a sunny day in the 90s. When you come out of that attic the 90s will feel like a cool spring day. The climate has always been changing and always will you idiot. Your movement is the biggest fraud going. It's always been hilarious the people that make tons of money pushing this narrative have some of the biggest carbon footprints. Do as I say not as I do. You bitches can suck a dick.

It's easy to produce a handful of scientists who will disagree on almost any subject, that's how science works. It doesn't mean the dissenters are always right. Just look at the record of the people driving the anti science, they are the same people that drove the claim that tobacco smoke was not a factor in the cause of some cancers. Corporate liars, murderers in actual fact. Anyway, it's time for the world to stop looking to the US, the country is infested with liars and grifters. Its political system is almost totally corrupt, it's media is mostly owned by a handful of billionaires and is utterly dishonest. The country is awash with cheats and scam artists.

The idiot democrat AOC said.: we have 12 year to go before the end of the world, tell that to children, they will freak out and support the idiot, they won't look in the data that prove otherwise, they will believe and repeat it, most importantly they will do anything to prevent it, not to save the planet but to save themselves. What they don't know is, the teachers talking about man made global warming are the same idiot that where brainwashed in the 90s they are the All Gore idiots repeating that the end of the world will happen in 2013-2014-2015. Now according to AOC it will happen in 2028. Idiots don't know they are idiots, they are only good repeaters. For some reason idiots are now socialist school teacher telling children that they are smart for repeating the lies. Good luck convincing an idiot who think he's smarter than everybody else.

They were using a terrible random number generator until the mid 80's. My statistics professor used to make fun of them all the time, "they may know how to build rockets but they don't know a thing about statistics". I don't know shit about climate science but I do know data science. All statisticians agree there is a correlation between the two. ***Not causation, but a correlation***. Whether there is causation we may never know but to rule it out due to a lack of understanding by everyone is terribly stupid.

Got my refrigeration license in 1992 before it was mandatory. I've owned my own company with 14 employees. I have much more knowledge about this then the above avg person So now simpleton you think in 1988 or even 1998 that problem was solved? They stopped making the gas R12 in the early 90s. R-22 they didn't stop making until 2010 and you could by it until about 2016. The government made it out to be worse then it was. They added a tax to the r12 first. Price went up 500-700 dollars in a few months. Same thing happened with the r22. I paid 60 bucks for a 30lb cylinder in 2008 in 2014 it was over 400 bucks. t They made billions of that bullshit tax. I'm not saying it didn't hurt at all but not near what they claim. Not only that those systems are still around today in many homes. If his model was correct it still should have come true if it was actually based of facts. Not what they overly exaggerated. The CFC gas only hurts when a unit leaks the gas and it can then escape. It also takes 2 years for the gas to reach the stratosphere. If his model was correct they would have still been plenty of gas around for the water to raise like he claims. The gas was still made until 2010 That's 22 years after his prediction. The gas was still used on a large scale until about 2014. There's still millions of equipment out there that have the gas. So its been widely used for almost 30years since the1987 agreement to phase it out. Even if 50% was gone for argument sake which it wasn't but if that happened in 2010 when they stopped making the equipment with. Thats still 20+ years from his prediction. If he was even close to being correct the water still should have went up close to what he predicted. The water has hardly moved at all because he was completely full of shit. You can try again maybe one of this time you'll get something right. Although you keep failing miserably.

You asked for a name and I gave you a NASA scientist. What was your response nothing because you don't have one. So you changed the conversation to something I didn't claim wasn't true. Since you couldn't respond to me after I answered your question. Try this one and again it's from your heroes from NASA. Why does the 2000 NASA temperature graphs show less global warming between 1950 and 2000 from the graph that was done in 2017 in that same time period between 1950 to 2000. Both come right from NASA. They're the same report just with 17 years added. Everything from 1950 to 2000 should be the same as the original report. Problem is it doesn't come close to matching. The answer is easy but I'll tell you because I'm not sure you can accept scientific facts yet. They change the graph to reflect the global climate change narrative. You can keep talking out of your ass if you want but I'm proving you wrong with your own NASA sources. The smart scientists you say know all the facts. Your right about one thing. They do know facts. It's to bad they don't report what the facts actually represent. They change data to keep with the narrative. I'm not some young kid or uneducated fool that just believes what the MSM and the globalist elites want me to think. I read and look at the data. I listen to both sides and then and only then do I decide what is most logical. I don't rely on bullshit information from people I know are not telling the complete truth. Most of these morons that hold political office positions who push this bullshit don't believe in the narrative they're pushing as much as you think. They're using it to control people and sneak more progressive and socialist programs in without people realizing how bad it is until it's to late. The real fools are the people who want to depend on the government for everything. They will say and do anything for a vote. Once in office and get the power they're looking for they'll drop you and tell you to go duck yourself (behind closed doors) until the next election cycle. Then repeat the process all over again.

Those records are hanging over the warmest&#39;s heads and time is not on their side. They&#39;ve bet their careers on this and they have the most to loose in that regard. Just to give one devastating example: <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pubs/solanki2004/solanki2004.html">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pubs/solanki2004/solanki2004.html</a> and what it means overall <a href="https://www.electroplatetectonics.com/">https://www.electroplatetectonics.com/</a> <br /><br /> &quot;According to our reconstruction, the level of solar activity during the past 70 years is exceptional, and the previous period of equally high activity occurred more than 8,000 years ago. We find that during the past 11,400 years the Sun spent only of the order of 10% of the time at a similarly high level of magnetic activity and almost all of the earlier high-activity periods were shorter than the present episode.

The elites hate the fact that ordinary individuals in the west now have unprecedented freedoms, money - and power. They aim to take away most of our freedoms, including free speech, property ownership, sovereignty, rule of law etc, the things we little guys have struggled for centuries to get. Europe is already well down the path to totalitarianism. If Hillary had won, the US would have been gone too. In the US, the fanatical Nazis on the left are fighting back, and are funded by many hard-left globalists and billionaires like Steyer and Soros. Other backers are the UN, EU bureaucrats, most of the media, Hollywood and useful idiots such as yourself. It is clear that you are on the side of the UN's insane agenda and that of these people.

I point out the fact that the temps where I live are below average, because they are, but I still recognize that temps may be warming globally. The question isn't about whether or not the climate is changing, because the earth is always warming and cooling, there have been times when the earth was much cooler than it is now, and there have been times when the earth was much warmer than it is now. The question is about whether excess co2 is going to create catastrophes that otherwise wouldn't exist, or is this whole thing just political fear mongering.

Think of the northern USA, Canada, Russia, the south American places like Peru etc. The agricultural areas that could benefit by higher co2 (plant food, plant air) and a longer growing season. They may get another crop off before a shorter winter dormant cycle. Some sub Saharan African countries would be less bearable but these are the least productive places on earth and the areas of very low IQ and very high corruption.

Intensifying weather and storm surges have always been predicted as a major component of climate change. No one with a triple digit IQ will fail to see that you are trying to move the goal posts. Insurance companies can't afford to pay for the high cost of global warming storm events. You are strawmanning about catastrophic sea level rise that will obliterate the Florida coast.

This one specifically states "The decision to do so is based on the staggering losses they incurred from weather events such as Hurricane Sandy. Their decision is also because of diminishing financial strength due to the downturn in the economy." They don't believe that the homes will simply disappear under the sea ... they're worried about having to pay for storm damage. That's NOT "global warming" that will "cause the seas to rise by many feet, flooding coastal lands." The fact that the "climatologists" made those claims a few years ago, and did NOT predict the recent batch of hurricanes, shows that THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO MAKE LONG RANGE FORECASTS. Otherwise they would have been telling us five or ten years ago to expect lots of hurricanes instead of major sea rises. Now they're hedging their bets by calling for "extreme weather." What it means is THEY HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE, and are hoping that if ANYTHING "unusual" happens then they will say "See, we were finally right! We predicted that the weather would CHANGE, and IT DID!" Titanic tornados, Batman! ANYONE can predict that "something baaad will happen" and then wait until any possible "bad" event occurs and claim that they're a genius.

The cosmic rays have a great role in the creation of clouds, and these clouds reflect most of the heat back into the space. Less cosmic rays leads to less clouds, which leads to less reflection of solar radiation, which leads to more heat received by earth. The resultant direct increased solar heat received causes the dissolved CO2 in oceans to rise up into the atmosphere (which is hundred to thousand times more in quantity than what is produced by technology in the modern world), leading to rise in CO2 levels. Bur even then this CO2 is too small to cause a noticeable change in the global temperature. Most of the warming that occurs is because of the lack of formation of clouds due to the above chain of events starting from sun spots. The world from ancient times always had rise and fall of global temperatures, and most probably in direct correlation with the amount of sun spots present in the sun during the given time.

Corbyn is a maverick and what he says does not pass basic climate science test. With zero CO2 this planet would be like the moon,but thanks to this wonderful gas and other greenhouse gases at the right level we have life. Therefore the more CO2 the higher the temperature.

I've even bought the Merchants of Doubt book and movie (Naomi Oreskes) to convince my friends. However, slowly but surely, lefty socialist Piers Corbyn has forced me to reconsider. To my huge embarrassment, I have concluded I've been wrong wrong for 20 years. - The 97% figure is a lie I'm afraid. I'm not a fox news viewer. I would never believe anything they told me. I'm very much on the true left. It hurts to admit that the GOP is right about something.

Why is it fair for us to withhold the use of such a powerful resource from the developing world based on what is starting to look like some pretty faulty and misleading arguments. (science???) This may sound fluffy or frothy, but take a look at those kids in the third world and say "sorry, none for you , just in case!" This subject needs conversation and at this point I d say there is a pretty good argument to let the FF burn, just in case. Its not so much about saving money for me as its about quality of life for the planet. Surely we in the west can lead the way, develop new energy sources, continue to improve the use of the ones we have. Work on efficiency. Those things though are not luxuries the third world have at present. I m not sure I can support a fear inducing movement which quite possibly is doing more harm to humans than FF ever could.

UgzN7Sr3RNAobUzQE5Z4AaABAg	1	0	2018-10-24 20:42:51	Ebrelus	Hi. So what credibility has this theory here:<br /><br /><a href="http://theendofthemystery.blogspot.com/2010/11/venus-no-greenhouse-effect.html">http://theendofthemystery.blogspot.com/2010/11/venus-no-greenhouse-effect.html</a><br />&quot;Venus is closer to the Sun, and gets proportionally more power from it. Earth is 93 million miles from the Sun, on average, while Venus is only 67.25 million. Since the intensity of the Sun&#39;s radiation decreases with distance from it as 1 over r-squared, Venus receives (93/67.25) squared, or 1.91 times the power per unit area that Earth receives, on average.<br /><br />Since the radiating temperature of an isolated body in space varies as the fourth-root of the power incident upon it, by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the radiating temperature of Venus should be the fourth-root of 1.91 (or the square-root of 93/67.25) = 1.176 times that of the Earth. Furthermore, since the atmospheric pressure varies as the temperature, the temperature at any given pressure level in the Venusian atmosphere should be 1.176 times the temperature at that same pressure level in the Earth atmosphere, INDEPENDENT OF THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INFRARED ABSORPTION in the two atmospheres. In particular, the averaged temperature at 1000 millibars on Earth is about 15¬∫C = 288K, so the corresponding temperature on Venus, WITHOUT ANY GREENHOUSE EFFECT, should be 1.176 times that, or 339K. But this is just 66¬∫C, the temperature we actually find there from the temperature and pressure profiles for Venus.<br /><br />[Note: The derivation of the radiating temperature above is for absolute temperature, in degrees Kelvin (K), so the 1.176 factor relates the Kelvin temperatures, not the Celsius temperatures.]&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The Venus atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, and supposedly superheated due to a runaway greenhouse effect, yet that portion of it within the pressure bounds of the Earth atmosphere is remarkably like the Earth in temperature. This is student-level analysis, and could not have been neglected by climate scientists, if they were not rendered incompetent by their dogmatic belief in the greenhouse hypothesis. (Again, the overwhelming extent of fundamental incompetence exhibited by scientists today is the real underlying story.) This result also flies in the face of those who would say the clouds of Venus reflect much of the incident solar energy, and that therefore it cannot get 1.91 times the power per unit area received by the Earth -- the direct evidence presented here is that its atmosphere does, in fact, get that amount of power, remarkably closely. This in fact indicates that the Venusian atmosphere is heated mainly by incident infrared radiation from the Sun, which is not reflected but absorbed by Venus&#39;s clouds, rather than by warming first of the planetary surface. (It also indicates that the Earth atmosphere is substantially warmed the same way, during daylight hours, by direct solar infrared irradiation, and that the temperature profile, or lapse rate, for any planetary atmosphere is relatively oblivious to how the atmosphere is heated, whether from above or below.) This denies any possibility of a &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; on Venus (or on Earth), much less a &quot;runaway&quot; one. This has already been pointed out recently by physicists Gerlich and Tscheuschner, who have written succinctly, &quot;...since the venusian atmosphere is opaque to visible light, the central assumption of the greenhouse hypotheses [sic] is not obeyed.&quot; Yet they are ridiculed by climate scientists, who thus behave like spoiled children who refuse to be chastised by their parents.&quot;<br /><br />What do you think?

[Check out what the Paris Climate Accords are really all about. There is no accord whatsoever -- just a bunch of nations saying what they have done, will do, promise to do, hope to do, or maybe will do sometime in the unknown future, about climate control.

I for one prefer to hear both sides of the discussion and make up my own mind, not be steamrolled by one sided arguments such a made by climate alarmists. After Gore&#39;s documentary, I was very concerned and alarmed. But after watching many qualified climate scientists criticize the consensuses by using strong data evidence, I now count myself among the skeptics. That doesn&#39;t mean I am against moving to renewable energy, I want that because of pollution concerns and other benefits of switching. Humans only add a small contribution to the co2 in the atmosphere which is itself only a small amount of the total greenhouse gases so why worry? Better to focus attention to ADAPTING to whatever changes occur, in my opinion. Seems obvious that major climate changes are afoot, so we better get busy!

Let's spend energy in improving the quality of life no matter what changes occur. Increase clean energy production. Move population centers away from shorelines, and build ports and shipping centers so that the sea level matters less. (That will also improve logistics when only cargo shipping is moving in and out of dock areas, and people aren't crowding the space.) Build more desalination plants so that there is dependable fresh water despite changes in rainfall. (Israel now gets most of its fresh water from the sea.) And if we REALLY get our shit together, let's tackle big projects like making the Sahara desert bloom green again, as it has in the past. That project alone could moderate temperatures over the Mediterranean and Europe and would also provide enough extra food to feed Earth's billions. And even the ones who believe that we have to draw down atmospheric carbon would have to agree that alternating patches of forests and croplands across northern Africa would be "a good thing." Turn the Arabian desert into a huge solar electric generation grid or else make it a ginormous rectenna farm for the first solar power sattelites to beam down electricity from orbit. Find projects that everyone can agree and MOVE FORWARD, instead of trying to force everyone to reduce their quality of life and reduce energy consumption.

Yet these messages I am getting, like the ones expressed in videos like this cause concern. After all, I am the one who is being asked to throw ridiculous amounts of money on a fire to quell the abstract fears of a politically motivated movement.(There are reductions, efficiencies and new tech evolving naturally through market forces and our abundance) Can you tell me how many dollars will reduce a particular amount of CO2 and by what mechanism specifically? Can you enlighten me please on what is meant by CO2 saturation? Does it have to do with solar interactions? Does it mean plants only can use so much before we see diminishing returns? Both? Is it just bunk? I have no idea but am hearing at a point we can dump twice as much in and will not receive twice the greenhouse effect? Your final paragraph does not ring true with much I have seen spoken by what I assume are competent people.(University professors, climatologists, physicists, environmentalists) Melting sea ice? Is it not true that while the North has seen a reduction the South has seen an increase resulting in a net increase? Is it not true that we really only have been able to measure the polar caps reliably for perhaps a couple of decades? Meaning we have no baseline to make claims that anything extraordinary is happening, let alone attribute something we scarcely understand is attributed to human influence? Is it not true that CO2 levels are at an incredibly low level as compared with historic levels and that our trees are essentially starving?(Certainly not thriving?) Is it really true that things like hurricanes and forest fires are at unprecedented levels? Is it true that there are SCIENTISTS claiming they are even though temps are shown to be pretty much static for ...what...15 plus years now? Perhaps you have had the alarmist rhetoric crammed down your throat so long that you think that's all there is? We all need more education. I think you may be under-estimating that "thin" argument. Consensus and science do not belong in the same sentence.....methinks. Always question. Is not climate science in its infancy? I do not wish to present here as someone who says screw it all. We need not be responsible. With that said there is what I consider incredible advancements in how we produce energy. I m an electrician. No shit that today I wired up a carbon scrubber connected to the exhaust of a natural gas cogen system in one of the 100 plus unit apartment towers my employer built. The cogen itself provides power to the building(225KVA), the incredibly hot exhaust (1500-2000 c) run through a heat exchanger and provides radiant heating piped through hrvs in every unit and then(the exhaust)is routed through the scrubber which, according to the fellas who provided it, will produce one tonne of carbon every ten weeks or so which is valued at 4 to 5 thousand dollars.(Can) We shall see how it works. I simply am suggesting that use of fossil fuels can be done responsibly and does not deserve the over hyped and perhaps irrational scorn of climate alarmists.

How many years old did the 97% estimate come out. The evidence is stronger now. and only idiots think that consensus doesn't belong in the same sentence as science. Science is BUILT on consensus. Newton - consensus. Einstein - consensus. Maxwell - consensus. Quantum Theory - consensus. We wouldn't be able to teach science in high school or college or more advanced if we didn't have consensus on what we were teaching. The only places where there isn't consensus in science is where the research isn't finished yet. It's a very thin argument to say the research on man made climate change isn't past the consensus point. Oh, and you're quoting an author. and you're ignoring all the stuff that was predicted 15 years ago that DID come true, a warmer arctic, melting sea ice, melting ice shelfs, continued warming, warming oceans, migrating species, larger droughts, larger floods, even the hiatus was predicted. So many things were predicted correctly. You've just had the bad predictions repeated so often that you think that's all there is. Hibbs, you need an education. What you think you know just ain't true.	UCRhPF-_VTB8gDtU84f9gTEQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhPF-_VTB8gDtU84f9gTEQ	1	UgyJZMMsPbgk2BUh5BJ4AaABAg	YTEdy

To say nothing of the fact that the word consensus does not belong in the same sentence as science. Also correlation does not show causation. The man made global warming conspiracy theory is in serious trouble. People are still arguing it with bunk data from 10 to 15 years ago which has been substantially discredited with science(most I ve seen from conspirators is over priced, useless models) not to mention real world measurements. What was claimed was going to happen 15 years ago has not happened in any way. Not even close. Its all fantasy methinks!

It's better than 99% among people with PhD or better education in this field. There's also all the evidence. Ice is melting and faster rates. The Earth is warming and the atmosphere is behaving exactly like it would be expected to behave with an increase in greenhouse gas. The Troposphere is expanding, the stratosphere is shrinking and the Earth is warming more around the Poles and at night than around the Equator and during the day. The evidence is strong. All the 97% ratio proves is that 3% of the people surveyed are morons - which is better than I can say for the republican party where over 50% of them are absolute morons.

But they grew too many trees that sucked the carbon out of the atmosphere so the Earth cooled down, and the dinosaurs overtook them. Then the dinosaurs died out because they all started driving cars and changed the climate again. Seriously, we have seen MASSIVE changes in the historical record gioing over BILLIONS of years, and life went on. Humans weren't around to cause these dramatic changes, so unless we want to assign ridiculous anthropomorphic fables like the above, that insects or dinosaurs were agents of climate change, then we also need to accept that our own meager changes are not that cataclysmic, either. All of the human explosives ever used in war, including atomic weapons testing, pale before the amount of energy of a single Krakatoa or Tugunska event. The Chicxulub strike made greater climate changes than anything these alarmists are saying, and that wasn't anything like the biggest strike this planet took. (Not to mention the hit(s) that carved the moon out of the side of the Earth.) Saying that we are somehow making changes GREATER than any of those is like a toddler insisting that he's stronger than a bulldozer. It'n not even braggadocio but rather laughible childishness.

So, comparisons with the past are null and void due to no unnatural activity in the past.<br />The ever increasing amounts of methane in the atmosphere is ignored also. <br />Fracking was started with the knowledge<br />that gas would surface anyway. Especially due to the use of HAARP which can, and sometimes does, cause earthquakes.<br />No mention of this important stuff by scientists. They are all gagged.<br />God help us.

Put your violin down. I used to identify as left coming from a working background, farther in the police - 27years. He endured far more than any CID member is legally allowed to today - crime involving kids, 27 murders - it was mentally more than hard. I had 3 jobs 7days a week and rode a bike there and back. when I joined the military and did much better than my high school grades would suggest. I had special selection for some areas I excelled in - I can't paint therefore I am not an artist. All you are doing is moaning and throwing stones with the sole intent of insulting debate. The "far right"?? please grow the fuck up mate. You probably have wet dreams about that in your imagination, you are a media junkie in an era with algorithms that like to polarise pople. YOU are the ones politicising science. WE "The people you should refer to as "the grown ups" ACTUALLY care more about this world, the policies we make and the important decisions made that affect all the people on it. That includes sheep like you used to xbox controllers over a 102key keyboard. Your generation post as "experts" on computers writing "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" incorrectly without even knowing it's meaning, background or function. Before your Facebook page or smartphone or twitter account the real people doing science you can refer to as "Grown ups" once you get you head out of your own fragile pathetic arse, your face out of a sheep pen (smart phone pigeonholing groups) PLEASE do bring ALL the EVIDENCE to the table. Maybe the Nazis want to discuss - if you had balls at least you would want to infiltrate? gain information on your enemy? understand if the lable of far right actually is correct? the MIDDLE is now a polarisation because your own ego IS more important than The truth. why are they evil? why are they crazy? You have NOTHING scientific to bring to the table because you are (at least in that post) an emotional moth surrounded by UV lights. Do yourself a favour and at least LOOK at the DATA that opposes your religious ideology. And show some respect for once in your life! your freedoms ARE because of "the evil" you are indoctrinated to believe. Maybe write some comments based on your scientific take? instead of maybe paper on what thou think a worm dreams about because it makes a nice story. You and your cronies, insult, disrespect, and your mind is so closed of it may as well be the grave it dug itself when social media took over your sad sorry life.

It sounds good so it is used to sell a variety of policies. Policies that don‚Äôt necessarily all result in individual citizens having more liberties. When I say group think, I‚Äôm referring to elected representatives voting the way leaders in their party tell them to instead of doing as their constituents tell them to do (how does having a party whip help an elected official represent the wishes of their constituents?!?!). Reps. in both parties do this and it should be considered an act of treason against the people. Reps. who resist party leaders have more to loose because their party will be less likely to support them. There‚Äôs nothing cowardly about not doing what most of your group is doing. Far from it. You can‚Äôt possibly mean that. This country was founded on the idea that people (at the time it wasn‚Äôt for all of the people) living here should have have a choice in how they are governed. By saying that we must for all time live under laws written by those long dead you loose that principle liberty. Should we add a constitutional amendment that says there can be no more constitutional amendments and decide the fates of all future generations our selves? I believe the constitution got many things right, but I think it gives government too much power and the people too little. There were many things that no one could have foreseen at the time it was written. And now, because of how much we‚Äôve lost due to that lack of foresight, it will be almost impossible to elect people who will rebalance things. Do you really think we have any say in who our candidates are? Not unless I‚Äôm responding to a billionaire. I don‚Äôt live in Wisconsin, so what I think of Paul Ryan is irrelevant. He was not in office to represent me. If a representative does what their constituents tell them to do, I have no place speak against them. I don‚Äôt live in Arizona either, but if the good people of Arizona feel that he did as they told him to do, then they are doing better than most US citizens and good for them for finding someone who was NOT a RINO (REPRESENTATIVE in name only).

The rest are by definition group-thinking tribalists who put party before everything else, who surrender to the higher ups in their party even when the people they are supposed to be representing want them vote a another way. In other words, they are AINOs (American in name only).¬†A party should be no more than a means to an end. The right's interpretation of the constitution puts the dead in place to rule over the living (depriving us a government of the people living today) as well as coming up with whatever interpretation suits the current agenda (just like the left) and calling it "constitutional". Which looks great on a bumpersticker but, when you boil it down, it's nonsense. You can call pushing your agenda "Sticking up for American sovereignty" if you like, but if you think that is more than a sales tactic, you're not fooling everyone else, you're fooling your self.

UgyNr6gb8fVlI3Hg7dV4AaABAg	0	0	2018-08-29 20:21:39	Dan Pride	The<br />Most Terrible Crime<br />in Human History<br /><br />Unabom shaped the public&#39;s attitudes toward environmental issues for decades adding ridicule and derision of the most powerful sort. The CIA and its linked Petro powers saw what the environmental movement did to smokestack america, and the Unabom case was their response to protect their profits. Unabom and its massive wave of carefully designed publicity shielded oil company profits, as intended, from the environmental movement with a cloud of manufactured ridicule, irrelevance and indifference.<br /><br />Unabom was the most published news topic in history before 911. The case was carefully designed for maximum press coverage using endless publicity tricks. Bombings in pairs, weird intricate (very) discuss-able bomb designs, and dozens of other similar tricks were carefully designed into the case. Bombing in pairs for example, creates coverage for the first one, endless talk about will there be a second one, then coverage of yes it really did happen,... and then you look really smart when it happens, and then you get coverage for that.<br /><br />The Obsession with the volume of coverage was for a purpose. Just such a heavy volume with repetitive impact was required to enable it to manipulate the implicit bias values for a host of environmental terms. Using incredibly powerful tools, tools only recently understood in academia and described in NPR&#39;s The Culture Inside, Unabom cut the legs from the environmental movement at the worse possible time. It systematically redefined implicit value combinations by repetition across the population. The massive publicity wave was targeted at Term groupings and chains related to the environment and to the default social status of the environmentalists themselves. The Change in the spelling of Unabomber to Unibomber after the arrest was a root value affecting all others.<br /><br />Unabom based publicity ultimately provided the margin of difference and then some to elect greenhouse gas promoting George W Bush 4 years later, not environmentalist Al Gore. It went on to provide the basis for much of the anti-environmentalist propaganda and anti-environment attitudes that have both dominated and debilitated ecological debates since... Eco-Nut, Tree Hugger, Funny (not to be taken seriously) environmentalists, etc etc. It debilitated efforts to limit greenhouse gas output right when it mattered most. Something to think about when you begin to gasp for breath from the heat after the power fails.<br /><br />The perpetrators of this penultimate crime against humanity bear much of the responsibility for the murder of not just one human or three or six million, but of all life,... quite possibly forever. They are indeed central figures in the silencing of the songbirds of earth...<br /><br />As terrifying heat waves rapidly enter the 120s, 130s and 140s, and we have our first mass death of thousands in a major city somewhere in the world... only then will the world stop laughing, and examine this case with the detail and the horror it so richly deserves. We are in new territory with Unabom. This is the next rung up the ladder from the Nazi&#39;s and Genocide. The three direct bombing casualties are dwarfed by the planet wide impact on all life for millennia which is just now beginning to take hold, and which was done by design in this case. The purpose was unrestricted and massive Oil Profits, but the real impact was both known and ignored.<br /><br />Unabom requires another International Nuremberg trial. This time, the audience will be watching the perpetrators of crimes,... not against victims passed, but crimes which will soon devastate and kill they, the audience, themselves. Will we see justice for the billions about to die in soon-to-be terrifying killer heat waves, and for the trillions who will never be born... or are we going to go along and get along for the few years we have left?<br /><br />God is watching.<br /><br /><a href="http://unabombers.com/">http://Unabombers.com</a>	UCqmNVjNGRvFtKtRrP5c4MQQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqmNVjNGRvFtKtRrP5c4MQQ	0

If we fill a bathtub with water, then dump a 50# bag of sand in it, the water level will rise. Let&#39;s multiply that effect 100 trillion times every day and surely that would make a difference. That could possibly explain why we see a fairly linear rise in sea level, as erosional deposits should be &quot;fairly&quot; linear. Of course, I&#39;m ignoring the effects of isostasy with the added weight on the ocean crust and the lessened weight on the continental crusts.

In the meantime, glaciers the world over are melting. Arctic sea ice is nearing a point of being ice free in the summer. There is photographic evidence of this. What will an ice free arctic mean? For the conservative American, absolutely nothing, or if anything, new shipping routes. For the rest of the world, a meaningful change, and possibly a large impact on grain production. The world eats on the basis of large scale grain production from many countries, primarily the US, Russia, and South America. If we lose this agriculture of scale, billions of people could (probably will) starve. Historically, famines begin (and there have been many throughout history) when crops fail. It happens very quickly. When the Himalayan and other Tibetan plateau glaciers, which feed over 10 of the worlds major rivers, are gone (well on the way) at least 3 billion people in Asia (Pakistan, India, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, China, you know, the places that make all our stuff really cheap) will be affected. But Americans don&#39;t care about that, why should we? Please keep your head in the sand so that we can keep doing the usual. Screw the world.

Disregarding yours or mine confirmation bias toward whatever future, climate wise, may happen, as I noted above, there are observable changes in global ice sheets and glaciers. They are diminishing, and quite fast. Will the world be the same when they are gone? Will our only concern be governments coming to some new shipping agreements in the now ice free arctic? Will the arctic ocean absorb more heat due to loss of albedo? But now we are getting back to clashing "theories" where posters on the web go back and forth trying to prove each other wrong, to no overall affect. Best of luck with whatever your beliefs are.

My basic comment was all that has to be done is use the technology that is I am sure available to measure the planets and moon in our solar system to determine weather these other bodies are also warming up due to our sun. Then with that being done and knowing that our sun is going through a heating up period. Case closed, debate solved, theories out the door, conspiracy not needed. So why aren&#39;t these guys bringing up graphs on solar bodies around us. they have all these other useless graphs and my question would be who funds these guys???

Just don't think the answer will be as simple, but it might shed more insight on the suns influence. But you will have to take into account the two most important factors that other planets don't have...an atmosphere and life...unless you believe in aliens in our solar system. Life is the main source of control of the amount of carbon dioxiode in the atmosphere. Why? Because life tends to try to influence its environment to improve its reproduction rate. In a very hot atmosphere or a very cold atmosphere that is more difficult, so that's why we have a state in betwean. And humanity is undoing what nature was trying to do...have a balance in betwean extremes. Guess who created those giagantic oil fields in the ground? Guess why life chose carbon as its chemical base and not silicone, while silicone has very similar properties...

Except smog - that 's human: carbon particulate from incomplete oxidation of hydrocarbons (soot from burning coal, oil, methane, butane, propane, kerosene, gasoline, diesel, wax.... but that doesn't cause climate change. Climate change is driven by the Sun.: 100 degree C swings every 6 months. Lead was pulled because it caused birth defects and made people sick and stupid. So did CFC's. 'That nasty mess' is one of the most imortant developments in human history. Numerous indudtries were entirely dependent on gas and oil. Even so'called green energy is dependent on products from gas and oil (petroleum). Solid carbon (soot), carbon monoxide (poison gas -fatal in small amounts), and carbon DIE-oxide (essential nutrient for all plant life. plants produce the oxygen we air-breathers need to survive.The prefix meaning '2' is being badly abused for its fear factor.

The planet is cooling and has been for the last 11000 years. The sun drives the climate on Earth not man. We have had a brief worming period but that has ended. CO2 levels always follow temperature rise by decades. Our oceans hold vast amounts of CO2 and as they heat up they release CO2 the same as a warm beer fizzes more than a cold one. As sun cycle 24 winds down some time in 2019 - 2020 we will be deep into a &quot;Grand Solar Minimum&quot; with global temperatures dropping. Major snow storms will be the norm in the upper latitudes. Crop losses are already happening all over the world due to snow and flooding and will only get worse. <br />Silica rich volcanos will and are entering a major up tic all over the world due to increased cosmic ray influx as our magnetosphere grows weaker. It is now 15% weaker in the last 100 years the last 5% happening just in the last 10 years. Still unclear weather it will lead to a pole flip or just an excursion before moving back to its normal position. We do have pole flips around every 70000 years or so. As the field weakens more cosmic rays will penetrate the atmosphere and increase cloud nucleation and cloud cover. More clouds - more rain/snow. More droughts to come to the drier regions - adding to crop losses. There is a lot going on with our sun and planet that would just require too much time to cover here. Just know we are heading into a major cold period that may last for the next 50 years or longer. Do your own research the facts are out there. Your government has been lying to you and the world for the last 30 years about &quot;Man made global warming because of carbon emissions&quot;. It is all a hoax aimed at transferring wealth and power around the world to benefit the &quot;New World Order&quot; agenda.<br />Be safe everyone. Prepare. Peace be with you.

Yet, the pre-historic people who eventually developed into Native Americans, crossed the land bridge from Siberia to Alaska and eventually worked their way down the coast. So, obviously, all recorded human history has NOT taken place exclusively in the interglacial period. This happened 25000-40000 years ago. Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfLVYr38D0Q&index=4&list=PLaZ1TkpF3IGP9rw2F4nFcDiJ-1TV-EPN1&t=0s Link that details the length of the last ice age, when ended about 11700 years ago: https://www.livescience.com/40311-pleistocene-epoch.html To place ourselves on this timeline, western civilization is generally thought to begin with the taming of animals and acquiring the knowledge to grow grains, enabling the hunter-gatherers to settle down. This happened in Mesopatamia about 9000-11000 years ago. Just sayin, dude. (Btw, this is general junior high school knowledge, but I found links just to help you out.)

Global average temperature is always transitioning to be increasing or decreasing as is it a chaotic system with many influencing variable, most of them not understood or known and also inherently chaotic themselves with the exception of orbit and axial cycles that have a large role to play but do not align with other systems such as condition of the planets surface and composition of atmosphere or solar output etc. I've always found it strange that warming is presented as a threat considering how warmer conditions create more fresh water more land to produce food, and we are a species with a evolutionary origin of tropical environmental adaptation. It's much more difficult for our species to survive in cold dry regions let alone manage to thrive. We have risen as a species to what we are today as a direct result of a warming global climate. If the ice caps still covered the majority of the land in the northern hemisphere I truly doubt we would have progressed beyond wondering tribes even today still struggling to survive just as we were 12,000 years ago...

He is speaking about that one where earth is distancing itself from sun now after long time of being on closest distance period on path around sun (its not round). There was a guy who calculated how CO2 affect climate comparing earth to wenus - and found out that amount of heat correlates exactly with distance of earth and other planets to the sun. On wenus there is atmosphere nearly completely composed of CO2 while temperature is proportional to distance to sun squared. It's easier to analyse venus because it doesn't have water and the whole complex cycle of warmings/glaciasions while gases pressure is easy to count. http://theendofthemystery.blogspot.com/2010/11/venus-no-greenhouse-effect.html Check this out	UCJpEK6C3uEUkpvQHySXAkVQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJpEK6C3uEUkpvQHySXAkVQ	1	UgxpWVRARcMrgi6oX4N4AaABAg	Old Frugal One Hyper-Drive Movement

Are those predictions similarly accurate? Has this group (International Conference on Climate Change) published climate models that make predictions regarding future temps?<br /><br />We can argue about what impact CO2 has or does not have on climate stability. But while we argue, we should limit rates of putting carbon into the air (and we should limit rates of putting other materials into the air and water) so that they do not exceed what most people think is acceptable. In a democratic society, limits to impacts on the environment (rates of taking resources &amp; putting pollution) should be held to limits that are consistent with the will of the people at large.<br /><br />(The fact that 5000 ppm of CO2 does not kill astronauts is irrelevant if we are interested in maintaining a stable thermal energy budget for the Earth.) <br /><br />Biological Model for Politics and Economics:<br /><a href="http://gaiabrain.blogspot.com/2010/03/biological-model-for-politics-and.html">gaiabrain.blogspot.com/2010/03/biological-model-for-politics-and.html</a>	UCQNcrYA3VRBnhCuYQurbFnw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQNcrYA3VRBnhCuYQurbFnw	0

Again, these folks are so far out of their depth it&#39;s frightening. The guys in this video are NOT DRAWING A CONCLUSION! Thats the whole point! We do not have enough data and we do not have a model that works. <br /><br />Last, if all of your tests/models fail to prove your hypothesis, then your hypothesis was wrong and/or your experiment/model was poorly designed.

It will definitely blow your mind.<br />It&#39;s here, no paywall!<br /><br /><a href="http://spaceweathernews.com/spf/">spaceweathernews.com/spf/</a> <br /><br />Take the funding and politics out, and the real science emerges. Validated by prediction and failed attempts to disprove. By a simple application of Stanford&#39;s publicly available raw data from its solar polar magnetic observatory.<br /><br />You can yourself copy the data and paste it into an excel spreadsheet. You can generate a simple line chart of both poles and a simple math formula to combine those and create another line of total strength.<br /><br />Then insert the dated of the 37 ea, 8.0+ mag quakes on usgs, since 1974.<br /><br />You&#39;ll see the same chart as was used in that paper.<br />You&#39;ll also see that, as well with classical physics, the most simple and basic approaches to science, as that of nature, yield the most rational results.<br /><br />And you&#39;ll recognize that kinetic energy and heat does not work for a valid cosmology, any more than a valid climate model.<br /><br />Yet the simple approach of classical physics requires no modeling to explain. Their models are used to describe not explain. That&#39;s real science.	UC-CQl1V4W_SIrFj9WWopXgg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-CQl1V4W_SIrFj9WWopXgg	0

Certainly technological advancements will take place and renewable energy resources will become far more efficient and perhaps carbon resources won't be necessary. But we are so far from that point that to force this on the world now would be absolutely cataclysmic. I, for one, will not be one of those willing to lay down my life for the cause and I assume you are not, either. I'd like to wait until the transformation comes in time -- as it will -- instead of fast-tracking it now to the detriment of billions of humans. Hopefully the technology is moving faster than I believe, but I've not seen the evidence that makes me think that in my or my children's lifetimes we'll be able to heat our homes, fuel our vehicles and grow our crops solely through renewable energy sources -- at least not without depleting the global population by the billions.

Natural changes in the earth's temperature (as determined mainly by the earth's orbit) determine the amount of CO2 the oceans release into the atmosphere (when it's warmer, the oceans release more CO2 into the atmosphere) -- this then adds to more warming. In fact, simple water vapor is 90 percent of the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere -- CO2 is an extremely small fraction and does not guide the changes in temperature, it follows it.

At the &quot;Heartland Institute&quot; - partly funded by the fossil fuel industry and a charter member of the &quot;Merchants of Doubt&quot;. It is a shame to think that they would debase their reputations this way but ideology knows nothing of logic. Those here who describe the SCIENCE as being about control or depopulation or taxes or whatever damned fantasy they have invented for themselves to fear, really have no understanding of Science. This isn&#39;t political, the science never is, and on a global basis that idea is untenable and impossible, as scientists are of every religion and political leaning that exists... except for &quot;American Pseudo-Libertarian&quot;. This was politicized BY the damned Hearland Institute and it is utterly disgusting that people will substitute ideologically driven ignorance for actual information. Just remember what Jefferson said about ignorance and freedom. Real Libertarians know why what is being demonstrated here is unhealthy for the USA.

Ugze2bpNulcUZN1tBzZ4AaABAg	0	19	2018-02-14 20:14:17	Floyd DeBarber	The earth is a rotating unbalanced sphere. There is more land (mass) above the equator than below. This causes the earth to wobble in it&#39;s rotation. The amount of wobble is the angle of the earths tilt relative to the sun. If the angle of tilt was 0 degrees then the earth would have permanent ice caps at both poles. The whole planet does not warm and cool during the cycles of the ice age, the angle of tilt changes which changes the amount of sunlight on the poles and changes the distance between the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn. When the angle of the earth&#39;s tilt is small, ice builds up on the poles but more ice accumulates in the north because there is more land. This increase in ice in the north makes the earth more unbalanced, causing the earth to wobble more and increases the angle of the earth&#39;s tilt. When the tilt increases, more sun shines on the poles causing the ice to melt. When the ice melts the earth becomes more balanced, wobbles less, decreasing the earths angle of tilt. When the angle of tilt is small, ice builds up and the cycle starts again. It has nothing to do with you, your car or your furnace.

However, he was very instrumental in promoting the idea of taking the military version an making it available to the public an does deserve credit for that. But he never said he "invented" anything. As to #2 we did have a serious hole in the ozone until we banned chloro-fluorocarbons and the situation improved proving we can make a difference. And the fairly stable (slight rise) in global temperatures starting in 2000 and it's gone back to the sharp rise we've seen n the last 100 years or so. Here are the statistics https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/why-did-earth%E2%80%99s-surface-temperature-stop-rising-past-decade. As to deforestation, how you can say that isn't taking place is ignoring observable facts from the air.

As for #2 , nope, we had plenty of 'nonsensical alarmist' stuff before, from 'holes in the ozone', 'deforestation', 'run-away CO2 greenhouse effect', 'global warming', 'global cooling', etc. etc. None of those things turned out to be the doomsday events they were predicted as. Not saying there is no climate change. Of course there is climate change. Also, the 'army' isn't particularly more worried about global warming than any other part of a government, nor is 'global warming' actually accurate based on data we have today.

Here is what the European Environment Agency says about this subject: "The number of heat extremes has substantially increased across Europe in recent decades. Heat waves have caused tens of thousands of premature deaths in Europe since 2000. It is virtually certain that the length, frequency and intensity of heat waves will increase in the future. This increase will lead to a substantial increase in mortality over the next decades, especially in vulnerable population groups, unless adaptation measures are taken. Cold-related mortality is projected to decrease owing to better social, economic and housing conditions in many countries in Europe."

As for NASA "have cooled the past and warmed the present" misinformation, it appears you have been misled by the numerous websites that show you the ONLY the LAND adjustments, (which on the whole are indeed that way round) and somehow forget to tell you about the adjustments to ocean temperatures which are MUCH GREATER and warm the past. The OVERALL results of ALL (ie both land and ocean) the adjustments made to NASA temperatures series are as follows: 1. adjustments to the temperature series since 1970 have made hardly any difference to the GLOBAL warming trend (just 4% warmer than the unadjusted figures) 2. adjustments to the temperature series over the full period (1880 to 2016) have DECREASED the GLOBAL warming trend (20% slower warming than the unadjusted figures.) Those results are discussed in the following article, which you would do well to study: https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-data-adjustments-affect-global-temperature-records Ocean heat content is now measured by numerous automatic buoys that are able to descend to measure temperatures down to 2000m. There is no basis - other than your paranoia - for your claim that their results are "very suspect".

UgxSuXBMF-HgdYouC7x4AaABAg	3	33	2018-02-05 01:30:33	Ti McCormick	The most humongous problem pointed out by Mr. Cunningham is a persuasion issue. Not an issue of facts. Over 90 percent of the population of America does not know what a sine function is or how to structure a data set and analyze it. The speakers in this video and the 25 NASA scientists it represents is an infinitesimally small percentage of Americans who have the ability to understand math beyond the 12th grade level and how to apply it to real world problems. To win the war against the media‚Äôs pervasive influence, to spread climate misinformation, one must learn the art of persuasion at the media level and at the personal level. To achieve this goal, I would suggest beginning with reading two very good books on the subject of persuasion ‚ÄúInfluence‚Äù and ‚ÄúPre-Suasion‚Äù both by Robert B.Cialdini, Phd.. In addition, I would also suggest ‚ÄúWin Bigly Persuasion in a world where facts don‚Äôt matter‚Äù by Scott Adams. The people who believe the Al Gores of the world are persuaded by emotions because they really can‚Äôt tell the difference between data that represents a proper assessment and data that is presented to manipulate public policy. Presenting scientific data is not just about showing the data. Unfortunately, in today‚Äôs world how data is presented, to make you feel, is much more important.

I taught science in the 8-11th grades a few years. After about 5 years of it i knew we were doomed. The large majority of that generation is trained to reason with the I.Q of Jerry springer audience member watching a 30 second soud byte. The strategy of many social movements has been to get a hold of the youth in order to shift the direction of all culture. Its worked well for Hitler and many others. There is a reason the liberals have made it one of their highest priorities to gain control of curriculum and the school system.

I&#39;ll explain why there&#39;s no reason for any of this.<br /><br />Although the change was relatively small compared to the previous few years, in 2017 the people of Earth burned more fossil fuels than at any time in our history. Our average global carbon dioxide level last year (2017) was ~406.75ppm. An early announcement value but should settle close to that after adjustments. This is up from 400ppm in 2015, which is up from 350ppm in 1988, which is up from 300ppm in 1911. The Arctic sea ice continues to lose mass and area at a staggering rate. Greenland&#39;s ice sheet is melting faster than ever before. Antarctica is showing signs of change under the increased global temperatures, especially the west ice shelf. Ocean water acidity is continuing to rise as it has for decades causing problems for shell fish. Coral reefs have been hit very hard especially the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. There&#39;s much more but you get the picture.<br /><br />Now compare that to -&gt; The USA has pulled out of the monumental Paris Climate Accord which was an inadequate method to address climate change anyway. We&#39;ve also taken a largely free market stance on energy sources allowing fossil fuels to still rule our energy market. Scott Pruitt is in charge of the EPA, the one person least interested in protecting the environment with any sort of pesky regulation. Very few countries have moved off of fossil fuels and those that have tried seem to have stalled in their efforts. Looking around where I live in Pennsylvania I see lots of big houses with lots of people driving big cars to go to big stores and buy lots of stuff made in China out of raw materials from all over the world. I rarely see anyone walking along the road or riding a bicycle and the public transportation buses are small, few, and rarely used.<br /><br />Stepping back to see all of this I have to wonder... how exactly do you feel threatened? Arguing against human caused climate change is going to gain you what? No one is listening either way or making great effort either way. You&#39;ve won, every day for the last 300 years and the next 100 years, you&#39;ve won. What more do you need or want?

And the dozens of plants that manufactured the very specialised components no longer exist. And most of them did not pay to warehouse the mountains of blueprints and such when they closed their doors. And even if they _had_ warehoused everything for some unspecified reason, you could just say they were "fake" anyway because they didn't have enough security or something. It was very expensive and "painful" then, and it would be so today. If we _did_ decide to fund another gigantic moon mission today, we probably wouldn't use tech from the 1960's anyway. ....And, your premise relies on a NASA spokesman, which fatally undermines your position, now don't it.

And really man, I can be considered a skeptic as I think the benefits of CO2 outweigh the negatives, but stay factual please and don't go around saying sea level hasn't risen because the alarmists will point to you as an example of how ignorant skeptics are. The facts are that sea level is rising by 3-4 mm per year. If someone comes up and claims that we're all going to drown you can just point out that 3-4 mm per year is far from catastrophic and can be dealt with building sea defences. The narrative of sea level is going to rise by several meters and coastal cities are going to be lost to the waters is wrong.

I watched this video and left the following comment; "This is non-scientific nonsense. To point to a warming trend, and then to point to something that is also going up (i.e. CO2) and then say that b must have caused a is just too funny. Where is the evidence? Where is the published paper which quantifies any atmospheric warming, and attributes this to increasing CO2 in the real atmosphere? All the published papers which relate to this, in fact demonstrate the exact opposite; that a warming planet increases atmospheric CO2 through Henry's law. I think you have a long way to go with this before you will convince any real scientist."

They basically set up some strawman fallacies and then rebut them to make it look like they have an argument. Then they run thru some graphs and photos and after each one, they say...&quot;Nope...not gonna happen&quot;. That&#39;s not an argument either. They casually ignore observable facts like sea level rise when there are towns suffering those effects now. They also completely fail to mention (as most ppl do) that the individual effects of each climate changing &quot;driver&quot; must be added together. They are not happening separate of each other but they will be cumulative effects. And no mention of the numerous positive feedback mechanisms that are already causing conditions to change exponentially. They even said a thing or 2 that actually prove their argument wrong.

Im certainly not "full of it" as you say. I could waste a few mins snapping a photo of my yard and posting it here. But I wont bother. Oh...could you refer me to the source for your claim that 2014 had the largest growth in ice caps in 50 yrs? It's odd because Ive heard from numerous sources (actual climate scientists) that the arctic ice cover is at an all time low.

I live in SC which has higher temps throughout the year, and I've just now really started to pick up our cutting THIS WEEK. btw, NASA has shown that 2014 had the largest growth in the polar caps in over 50 years, but I suppose I can't just believe everything I see on the internet.

Trying to say that the sea level has risen or fallen, with any accuracy, in a 100 years is impossible. The most accurate modern method of measurement is satellite data which started in the late 70's. The satellite data shows an annual rise that is less than the accuracy of the equipment used. I measured sea level off the coast of east coast of India in the early 1990s and that data showed that sea level averaged .3 meters above the ellipsoid. 8 years later in the same spot the average sea level was about .1 meter below the ellipsoid. Does that mean that the sea level dropped .4 meter? Of course it doesn't. In this case it probably was do to undulations in the ellipsoidal MSL. Land or buoy data is incredibly inaccurate and should always be suspect. My point is that when someone is telling you with absolute certainty that MSL is rising 1-2 centimeters a decade, they are not being totally honest.

Hard to put a bunker in at sea leavel. How does buying cabon credits lower anything but you bank account? One volcano displaces every prius ever built in one belch.

The sun control's earth's temperature. Solar minimum has just started, solar minimum is the orbit of the sun becoming elliptical and the tilt of the earth. The earth wobbles on the degree of tilt. Every 11 years the the sun either gets more active or as we have entered a less active cycle. Together with the orbit and the tilt, we are actually entering the begining of an ice age. The south pole never saw warming and is getting thicker. Iceland has lost coastal ice but interior ice is growing. Polar bears have gone from 1000 to 4000 last census. Not from ice at all. They outlawed bashing baby seals heads in and now the abundance of seals have a natural progression for their predators, polar bears.

None have "advanced". They have receded dramatically. However, they do slide forward sometimes as water lubes the underside. Funny you mention 1730.

She handed me literature that said the glaciers have retreated many miles since 1860.... thus global warming. It was the KoolAid spun theory or I suppose she wanted to keep her job? I asked her if the retreating ice was because the local natives were racing around in diesel pickups 160 years ago. Then I queried her on her own government data that showed the glaciers are far more vast in their extent NOW then in 1730? Basically I pissed her off and the conversation started to wind down. When I asked her why the ice sheet on Greenland is thickening by several feet per decade and Antarctica is far colder now and larger than any time in our recorded history she had no words.

What concomitant effects would, likely, be observed in the earth atmosphere as the magnetic field revered itself. This was an excellent question since there have been a number of magnetic reversals in the earth&#39;s past and no human has witnessed one. The answer was excellent and , at one time, was available online - but mysteriously, (or not so mysteriously), this topic and the responses from the NASA scientists has disappeared from the internet. It would wonderful if some of the remaining NASA scientist would reveal this information again for an inquiring public that has, unfortunately, missed out on this sequestered NASA research effort.

Historically, this is not a valid methodology. If it were, we would probably still be learning that the sun‚Äîactually, the whole visible universe‚Äîis revolving around the earth. That was the ¬´consensus¬ª science of all the experts at the time of Galileo and his telescope. In fact, Galileo was put under house arrest, for life, because he denied the consensus belief‚Äîand, he was fortunate not to be burned at the stake by the ¬´experts¬ª of his day. Of course, the ¬´expert consensus¬´¬†turned out to be very wrong, and Galileo turned out to be right‚Äînot to mention, very lucky. By the way, Copernicus, the Polish priest, and astronomer, had already concluded, by looking through his own telescope, that the earth revolves around the sun, and he wrote it down, too. But, he understood what the consensus experts were all about, and, smartly, kept that knowledge to himself‚Äîhe would, more than likely, have been burned at the stake as a heretic‚Äîhe was a priest, you know. Times haven‚Äôt changed much: today, we have Bill Nye, ¬´¬†The Science Guy¬†¬ª, suggesting that anyone who question‚Äôs climate science‚Äôs ¬´Consensus¬ª, that humans are causing Global Warming, ought to be imprisoned‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt use the ¬´heretic¬ª word, but we all know that that‚Äôs exactly what he thinks the skeptics are. The point of all this history is to demonstrate that ¬´expert consensus¬´¬† is NOT, always, science. Real scientists always look for data that could negate their hypothesis. They test that data against what they hypothesize, and, if the data warrants it, either change, or drop, their hypothesis. But, real scientists don‚Äôt care who present‚Äôs the data they study‚Äîthey are only interested in the truth of what they allege in their hypothesis. Fake science refuses to allow anyone, not in their club, to question anything about what they are saying. Essentially, that attitude makes them, intellectually, no different than Fundamentalist religious. That attitude is definitely NOT. real science.

Col Walter Cunningham has an impressive CV, having a PhD in physics and he was an astronaut and he even has 5 years in meteorology in the 70's but he's only published one paper and that had nothing to with climate science (it was on why stars don't twinkle in space). It's hard to figure Thomas Wysmuller. Heartland institute has him down as a meteorologist, and apparently he did train as one in his undergrad. But his linkedin account shows no work related to climate science. Nor has he published any peer reviewed papers. Hal Doiron has a PhD in mechanical engineering. His linked in account indicates industry knowledge relating to aerospace engineering, aircraft, strategic planning which is perfectly consistent with his status as an aerospace consultant. But this has nothing to do with climate science and he has not published any journal papers (that I could find). So my point is that to attack the science, surely one should at least be trained in the science and working in the field. I suppose theoretically one doesn't need a PhD in a climate science discipline, but it does seem unlikely. My more important point is that if they wish to make serious and testable statements, then they should do the research, have it reviewed by scientific peers, and if no one has a problem with it, then their statements will stand. By not doing this they would be failing to debunk what they know to be junk climate science, making climate science all the poorer for it.

"Read over most any explanation of the ‚Äúgreenhouse effect‚Äù hypothesis that you find on the Internet and notice the following. The explanations will say that the ground, which has been warmed by the sun, will emit infrared radiation, but they will rarely point out that this emission of infrared radiation cools the ground. They will then point out that ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù in the atmosphere absorb some of the infrared radiation that the ground emits, which causes atmospheric warming. They will then point out that the warmed atmosphere will emit infrared radiation back towards the ground, which they say will warm the ground even further. A fact that is always left out of articles on the ‚Äúgreenhouse effect‚Äù hypothesis is the fact that the emission of infrared radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù cools the atmosphere as its thermal energy is drained to create the infrared radiation. The ‚Äúgreenhouse effect‚Äù hypothesis only sounds plausible because it only looks at one side of the equation‚Äîabsorption of infrared radiation causes warming. The other side of the equation is that the emission of infrared radiation causes cooling. I did the above experiment myself and this is what I found in the first 25 explanations of the ‚Äúgreenhouse effect‚Äù hypothesis found under the Google search ‚Äúgreenhouse effect.‚Äù 1) 100% mentioned that the ground is warmed by sunlight. 2) 100% mentioned that the ground emits IR radiation. 3) Only 12% mentioned that the emission of IR radiation by the ground causes cooling of the ground. 4) 100% mentioned that the absorption of infrared radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù causes atmospheric warming. 5) 100% mentioned that warmed ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù emit infrared radiation. 6) 0% mentioned that the emission of IR radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù causes atmospheric cooling. 7) 100% mentioned that the absorption of IR radiation emitted by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù warms the earth. 8) Only 8% mentioned that the atmosphere is also warmed by conduction, convection and latent heat (evaporation/condensation of water vapor.) So, when you omit the fact that both the ground and the atmosphere are continually being cooled via the emission of infrared radiation and leave out the fact that the atmosphere is also warmed by conduction, convection and the evaporation/condensation of water vapor you get this typical definition of the ‚Äúgreenhouse effect.‚Äù 1) The ground is warmed by sunlight 2) The ground emits IR radiation 3) 4) The absorption of infrared radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù causes atmospheric warming 5) Warmed ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù emit infrared radiation 6) 7) The absorption of IR radiation emitted by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù warms the ground 8) To demonstrate the effect that the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù has on atmospheric temperature let‚Äôs use the following mathematical formula. T + A ‚Äì E = T‚àÜ T ‚Äì Starting Temperature of the atmosphere A ‚Äì Heat acquired from the Absorption of infrared radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gas‚Äù E ‚Äì Heat lost due to the Emission of infrared radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù T‚àÜ ‚Äì Net Temperature Change due to the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù If Absorption > Emission = temperature goes up. If Emission > Absorption = temperature goes down. If Absorption is the same as Emission = temperature stays the same. The crux is this; the addition of heat into the atmosphere by convection mediated conduction and latent heat transfer causes the atmosphere‚Äôs temperature to increase without an increase of infrared radiation absorption. This increase in atmospheric heat causes the ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù in the atmosphere to increase their emission of infrared radiation. As a result ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù perpetually emit more infrared radiation than they absorb and therefore have a perpetual net cooling effect on the atmosphere as they work to expel this excess heat from the air. Unfortunately the ‚Äúgreenhouse effect‚Äù hypothesis changes the perpetual cooling effect of ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù into a perpetual warming effect by omitting two parts of the equation. The first omission is the fact that the atmosphere is partly (as much as 50% at times ) warmed by convection mediated conduction and latent heat transfer and the other omission is the fact that the emission of infrared radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù cools the atmosphere. This leaves the warming effect of the absorption of infrared radiation by ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù the only force in operation. Consequent to these omissions any addition of more ‚Äúgreenhouse gas‚Äù to the atmosphere will be seen to only cause more absorption of infrared radiation and therefore be seen to always cause more warming. Because of convection mediated conduction and latent heat transfer the atmosphere will always be warmer than it would have been through the absorption of infrared radiation alone. Therefore ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù will perpetually be compelled by this extra heat to emit more infrared radiation than they simultaneously absorb. Ergo ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù will have a perpetual, net cooling effect on the atmosphere. Let‚Äôs return to our flashlight analogy and ask, ‚ÄúHow can ‚Äògreenhouse gases‚Äô emit more infrared radiation than they absorb?‚Äù Answer: in the same way that a flashlight can emit light without having first absorbed light, the emission of infrared radiation represents the conversion of one form of energy to another. It represents conversion the kinetic thermal energy contained in the atmosphere into the electromagnetic energy of infrared radiation thus cooling the atmosphere regardless of where the heat came from in the first place. It is no more complicated than that; adding ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù to the atmosphere increases the ability of the atmosphere to emit more infrared radiation at a lower temperature and this drains heat from the atmosphere like the emission of light from a flashlight drains power from the flashlight‚Äôs batteries. If it were otherwise, if ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù actually had a warming effect upon the atmosphere rather than a cooling effect, the only method that the atmosphere has of cooling itself would be absent, which it demonstrably is not."

But if you are suggesting that CO2 cannot contribute to planetary warming because CO2 fails to directly melt ice when the two come in direct contact (i.e. an exothermic reaction - similar to lithium in contact with oxygen or calcium oxide in contact with water), then you misunderstand the mechanism by which CO2 (and all greenhouse gases) contributes to warming of the planet - i.e. the earth is warmed by incoming solar radition; when the eath then re-radiates this energy, it does so in the infrared frequencies. Energy that would normally go directly back out into space is blocked from doing so by CO2 which absorbs the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrometer . In simpler terms warming = (energy in from sun) - (energy lost to space)	UCMh25x5zuAp7nqF7KM9Ug9A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMh25x5zuAp7nqF7KM9Ug9A	1	UgwjC6fQc9qUjkpxaRx4AaABAg	Zoe Phin

Then the data began rolling in. We're talking actual real data from actual real measurements as opposed to largely accurate but derided trend analysis through mathematical models. And then the most amazing thing happened. The scientist slowly began to change their positions. Today, the amount of data available is overwhelming. And the number of "scientists" Heartland can trot out to support their lie shrinks almost daily. You want real data from a thousand sources? Pick up a copy of the latest NOAA climate assessment. 1,500 pages of real data from hundreds of independent sources. And you expect us all to believe that ALL of this data is wrong? Or that ALL of the thousands of scientist cited in the report are in a conspiracy to raise your taxes? Really? Why is it that ONLY Heartland is telling you the "truth"? Are you carrying Heartland's water because you've done your own research, looked at the latest data, and reached your own conclusion. Or is because you are way to busy to take the time to research such an important issue and what Heartland is telling you makes you feel good? Do you consider yourself a reasonable person who will go whereever the facts lead them? If so, spend a bit of time researching the issue whenever you can spare 5 or 10 minutes. Make a list, if only in your memory of the peer-reviewed research that supports Heartland's position. Then do the same thing for eer-reviwed research that supports the opposite position. Use Heartlands web site for the first source. For the second, I'd recommend using NOAA's latest assessment. At 1,500 pages it makes an excellent source if you are choosing only one. Each chapter in the report is meticulously prepared, with a separate bibliography citing all the peer-reviewed research used to compile the report. If you only spend 8-10 hours doing this, some things will become obvious. Anyone who has the courage of their convictions about denying such change is happening is going to need to read this NOAA report anyway. Why? Because the bar has now been raised significantly using real data and you'll need to be prepared to argue your view point by explaining how the vadt majority of studies cited are flawed and why. Simply dismissing it all as untrue is not going to sound very knowledgeable or convincing. Attempting to hild onto that position exposes the ridiculous claptrap above for the wishful thinking it is. So why is it that every time you look into who is funding these little farces, the Heartland Institute keeps popping up? The good news is that these little dog & pony shows are fooling fewer and fewer people. The crowd of people willing to buy the BS that Heartland and its paid cronies pump out grows smaller each year. It turns out that once people understand what the Heartland Institute is and how it is funded, it becomes much harder to believe in the fairy tale that the organization promotes. Though I will not live to see it, there is a day coming at some point in the future when Heartland and those who fund it will be held accountable for what, at this point, can best be characterized as depraved indifference. And those who were taken in, when they duscover that Heartland not only knew what the truth was but promoted a lie for the most basic of motives, will be very, very angry. I believe when that day comes, the pitchforks will come. While I will lukely be denied the honor of witnessing this fall, know that on that day, if there's a God above, I will stand and clap.

In my line of work we have a statistical process generically called MSA (measurement system analysis). What I have seen time and time again is flawed measurement systems, often influenced by human bias. I was happy to see this discussed in this video as I do believe that it&#39;s far more predominant than people realize. <br /><br />Here&#39;s an important question for you: Given the facts and the huge uncertainty around anthropogenic global warming, how do we as average citizens advocate for an unmasking of this great hoax? Yes, we can point people to these videos you have assembled, but clearly most people don&#39;t have the time to watch and learn. Do you think there are other ways we can engage people to turn the tide on the media frenzy around this hoax?<br /><br />Thanks again for your work and efforts in this regard Frolly. I for one really appreciate the hard work you have undertaken to gather and disseminate this information.	UC1OYhOUM1B1puijI2MJGB6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1OYhOUM1B1puijI2MJGB6A	0

The Global warming narrative suits the globalist agenda by presenting an opportunity to tie all the developed nations to a common policy. Those who support the advocates for AGW are sleep-walking us into a system that will be mandated to control the use of the world's resources. This is Communism and that is¬†the way the argument needs to be framed, in my view. Do we want to live in a world where people like Al Gore, Michael Mann and Gavin Schmidt have total control over the world's food and energy? When the Bolsheviks did that, look how it turned out for the Ukrainians. No, we must resist; there is much more than just the weather at stake here.

These lakes extend from the eastern Northwest Territories, through most of northern Canada, and the upper Midwestern United States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan) to the Finger Lakes, through Lake Champlain and Lake George areas of New York, across the northern Appalachians into and through all of New England and Nova Scotia. At times, the ice sheet&#39;s southern margin included the present-day sites of northeastern coastal towns and cities such as Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Boston, New York City, and Great Lakes coastal cities and towns as far south as Chicago and St. Louis, Missouri‚Äîand then followed quite precisely the present course of the Missouri River up to the northern slopes of the Cypress Hills, beyond which it merged with the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The ice coverage extended approximately as far south as 38 degrees latitude in the mid-continent.[2]<br /><br />Ok, who were the men who melted all that ice 20,000 years ago?

Increasing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increases that capacity, hence augmenting the increase in energy retention, resulting in increased temperature.

That helped melt snowfields and reduced sea ice and ice caps and thus decreased albedo - the darker surfaces replacing snow/ice allowed more solar radiation to be absorbed. As temperatures rose, atmospheric CO2 increased due to warming oceans/wetlands and increased rates of rotting. The increased CO2 augmented the warming via the greenhouse effect. Each of the three effects, orbital changes, reduced albedo and increased CO2 are considered to have had about the same warming impact.

CO2 monitoring in Hawaii clearly demonstrates the results of burning fossil fuels. Ice core analysis confirms we are in uncharted territory. The oceans have warmed. Permafrost is melting, Greenland and Antarctica are losing ice exponentially. Four mass extinctions correlate to temperature rise from increased CO2 levels in the past. Sure there are unknowns, most of which accelerate through feedback loops rather than mitigate. The science is everywhere and these guys have lived long enough to see the changes anecdotally.

The IPCC promotes a consensus i.e. conservative forecast. You agree the waste product of using fossil fuels, CO2, has changed the energy equilibrium of the earth and it , CO2, is responsible for some temperature increase. This increase alone can explain the observed melting etc. (your words). Albedo, the degree to which energy is absorbed or reflected/bounced back to space is a major component in the equilibrium equation. When the ice/snow melts the exposed land/water/dirty glacier surface absorbs 90% of the energy rather than reflecting 90%. This energy absorbed increases the temperature also and is a feedback loop. EXPONENTIAL BECAUSE NOW IT IS WARMER THAN WHEN THE FIRST AMOUNT OF ICE MELTED THEREFORE A GREATER AMOUNT OF ICE WILL MELT THAN THE FIRST TIME! This will continue until ice of the same vulnerability is gone and ice that is harder/less vulnerable/colder will warm and melt/evaporate. The poles are bombarded with sunlight 24/7 during the height of their respective summers absorbing most of the energy that once was not. This is one of the reasons the higher latitudes have had multi degree increases in temperature compared to the lower latitudes but it is not the only one. The thawing of the permafrost and the warming of the ocean will cause Methane, CO4, to be released into the atmosphere. CO4 is an even more effective greenhouse gas than CO2 so it will cause the temperature to increase in it's own feedback loop thawing even more permafrost and warming the ocean more. The combination of these and other feedback loops (algae thriving in melt ponds on ice for example unknown until recently) are more powerful than Carbon Dioxide. Once triggered they will continue unabated regardless, the tipping point, the point of no return. An outcome you seem blissfully unaware of and one that even AI won;t be able to conquer given man's frailties like the need for food and fresh water. Glacier fed springs and rivers will run dry and crops will fail in flood or drought, both possibilities forecast by the IPCC. Pointing out failed predictions of the past only re-enforces the notion they got it wrong and you sir are cotton candy. Overcoming the inertia of climate stability/predictability took a long, long time but we seem to have gotten the ball rolling. Expensive to fix you say? The fossil fuel industry has made trillions of dollars from their customers. Both are complicit in using the earth's atmosphere as a free dump for the waste produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. We were seduced by the energy/stability/flexibility/portability/reliability of fossil fuels and harnessing it opened up an orgy of possibilities elevating the standard of living almost beyond imagination. Naive to think it wouldn't have a cost-or just selfish, greedy and short sighted. Rather than change any minds I am inclined to believe critics will draw inspiration from my "diatribe" as discussed in the link from my previous response so live long and prosper, adios.

No research says the Earth is anywhere near the point to have a runaway greenhouse effect. The IPCC doesn't think so, none of serious scientists think so. Feedback loops amplify until exhausted is nonsense, the equilibrium climate sensitivity is a diminishing feedback loop, not an amplifying one. "The abilities of fast-reproducing marine life to be beneficial" doesn't make sense, and dead zones have nothing to do with ocean acidification. I can only assume you mean "things reproducing rapidly is bad" well when I said fast-reproducing marine life, I mean the marine life that's supposed to reproduce like rabbits and have a death rate like the rabbits. Marine life that reproduces in short intervals adapts to drastic pH change in a generation. Research the level of pH change near estuaries, and tell me why the shellfish there aren't all dead. Why are we waiting to convert to other forms of energy? Because inventing other efficient forms of energy takes tremendous intellect to do properly, which we can only have once we have AI. The dust bowl comparison does not make sense, the IPCC has gone to great lengths in researching the potential dangers of a 2-3C warming, we are essentially "Anticipating" the dust bowl. And I don't know where you saw that we are all going to starve in a few decades, show me verifiable papers. 200+ feet of sea *(level) rise, yeah that will happen when all ice melts. Which no serious scientist think will happen. We need to stop using what we have now because what we have now is absolute shit. The cure we have now is worse than the tiniest percentage of the disease that we can alleviate. Everything has a cost, things are not free. If it's free, sure, use it, if it costs a crap ton of resources, and it does next to nothing, only an idiot would try and use them. You don't see the ridiculousness in your comment "What if it's tomorrow?" Well, let's just say I misjudged you, you are the flying pig. And you're an atheist? Well then you must know that skepticism is a lot harder to foment than belief. You seem pretty confused there.

You have overestimated the abilities of fast-reproducing marine life to be beneficial (example:Dead Zones). The oceans are absorbing 1/3 of CO2 emissions forming carbonic acid (TED/talk). Why are we waiting to convert to other forms of energy? The dust bowl resulted from man's lack of foresight when screwing nature for easy money (example:every natural resource ever discovered). There are scientists who believe mankind will perish within a few years. Alarmists perhaps but when swaths of land stop producing food because of floods, drought and extreme heat chaos can not be far behind with 7 billion mouths to feed (planes could not even take off in Arizona). There are many unknowns going forward including just how fast Greenland and Antarctica will loose 200+ feet of sea rise (faster than anyone had predicted so far). Who we are looking for a solution ? AI will design a better mousetrap too, doesn't mean we should stop using what we have now. Something the scale of the Manhattan Project seems appropriate. Your pigs would fly and clouds would become cotton candy comment was disingenuous and not helpful in moving the conversation forward. And, I am an Atheist. Religious indoctrination is brainwashing and conditioning so by definition hard to crack that circular logic. Goodbye, friend.

There is no proof of the runaway green house effect that we should fear. I have no idea what you mean by passing the point of no return. No scientist has even mentioned a point of no return. The oceans are not becoming too acid, you significantly underestimate the adaptation abilities of fast-reproducing marine life. We are not consuming the last bits of fossil fuels, they will last for another century, by then we would have long switched to nuclear or have AI design some ingenious solution to extract energy from the environment. What if the future is tomorrow? Pigs would fly and clouds would become cotton candy. Remember the dust bowl? Was that caused by Global Warming? We are looking for a solution, and we would find it a lot cheaper and faster if we have AI helping us. Skepticism is easier to foment than belief? Tell that to the Atheists. It's easy to devote oneself to a belief, not so easy to devote oneself to the pursuit of truth.

It's usually called AGW, the C is implied. What is your argument? That CO2 just by remaining in a high level will cause a linear increase in temperature? I hope not, since no serious scientist will agree with you. CO2 is not the speed of increase, it's the direct increase. And I have no idea what you meant by "Don't appear to be tapped out" the science on the feedbacks are pretty clear, it's X degree of added warming per 1 degree of CO2 warming. Did you mean transient climate sensitivity? I don't see how that would be relevant at all. The precautionary principle is wrongly applied. According to the IPCC, even if their feedbacks are correct, we have around 50 -100 years before the warming start causing problems. Do you have any idea on what sort of technologies can be invented in 50 -100 years at the current rate? We might be looking at the second intelligence revolution with the advent of AI, to put you in perspective, the first intelligence revolution gave homo sapiens the ability to conquer the planet. It would be a freaking miracle if AI can't solve CO2 emissions, or significantly reduce the damage Global Warming will cause. And what can we do NOW to solve climate change? Delay it by 8 months...That's the what Obama's proposed plan can do. If you pay close attention, you would notice that 99% of changes are meant to happen after 30 years. Which is exactly my point, we would be much better prepared to deal with CO2 and the potential dangers of Climate Change in the future. The analogy here isn't a kid who's trying to delay doing his homework, it's a kid trying to do his homework for the rest of the semester before he actually taken the classes that would have taught him how to do them.

The effects of a constant amount of energy absorbed would be a linear increase in temperature. That increase appears to have had an effect similar to pushing a car from a flat to an incline where the force of gravity then takes over in an exponential way until terminal velocity is reached or someone puts on the brakes. Try to stop that car by pushing back and get run over. The feedback loops don't appear to be tapped out or even close to terminal velocity. I am not promoting a particular time line but AGW is real and it will cause dramatic changes in sea level, habitable land and the food chain. Dispute away but better to err on the side of caution than arrogantly forge ahead denying any responsibility for climate change lest we follow the Carrier Pigeon. Follow the money.

Expect to see them often. Even though the idiots are fun and easy to refute, It'll be more helpful to focus on the actual science instead of rambles of demonstrably false nonsense. Currently, the feedback, or equilibrium climate sensitivity, are mainly backed by historical records of temperature and CO2. That is far from enough proof, not only do they inflate figures by failing to account for reverse causality and third party influences, they fail to account for the major differences between Earth hundreds of millions of years ago, and today. Their flaws are reflected in the drastic variations between the predictions of different proxies, the 800-year delay and the temperature's speedy decline in spite of CO2 remaining in high levels, the lack of significant tropospheric warming near the equator even when such a discovery should have been obvious, and many others. The proofs you cited, oceans, permafrost, ice caps, they are supposedly in exponential change? Not quite, simple statistical work will tell you an exponential model provides no significant improvement over a linear model, which makes it extremely weak as an evidence. And, most importantly, their numbers do not reflect on the magnitude of the feedback, which is the main area of dispute by most scientists. CO2 has a long established warming effect of 1.1 degree Celsius per doubling, it alone can explain the oceans, permafrost, and ice caps. There are unknowns, and most of them are surrounding the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, or feedback, they are not other factors that gets amplified by the feedback, they are factors that affect the magnitude of the feedback itself. Flaws in the current theories are everywhere, these NASA scientists have lived long enough to see the failures of multiple preposterous predictions by climate models in the past, ones that are instantly forgotten by the masses as new prophecies arrive.

Infrared energy excites CO2 molecules and doesn't make it to space. Once trapped in your dynamic system it will move around but not disappear. A rise in temperature is one way to store the kinetic energy, chemical sequestration might convert some. A small temperature increase can set of feedback loops like loss of albido and so on and so forth but I am sure you have heard anything I might offer as reasonable science. The burning of fossil fuels has raised the level of CO2 in the atmosphere and ocean, man burns fossil fuels. Personally I think it would be great if I am wrong and you are right and we could carry on without concern. My grandfather used to get me a subscription to National Geographic every year. Every month the pages would reveal wondrous discoveries that were inevitably disappearing from the effects of human exploitation of the planet. When my aunt was going to continue his tradition I had her get me Popular Mechanics instead. Maybe AI will save the day and not eliminate us in the process.

Whether one believes that mankind is responsible for the "slight" warming of the planet or not the result would appear to be the loss of arctic ice and the thawing of the permafrost, both of which are multipliers in capturing energy from the sun regardless of the millions of years of once sequestered carbon being spewed into the atmosphere (and consequently the oceans) with the exploitation of fossil fuels. More energy would logically result in higher temperatures. That mankind has adapted in the past to gradual fluctuations in temperature is not at question. The question is how to adapt to the abrupt changes currently happening that will arguably place life destroying stresses on our habitat be it from extreme weather, ocean acidification or some other peril not yet known. That "they" are part of a conspiracy is hard to swallow when it has taken forty years to be taken seriously and at least one of you is getting his information from one guy with a ham radio near Antarctica.

He was down there with an American team of Comms engineers doing development work on under sea radio communications..subs have to surface to make radio contact. Not surprisingly, Ham Radio is his hobby and keeps in touch with home. "What you working on?" says I foolishly. "Can't tell you much but we're expanding a system which is known WW.and no secret there. We are developing Very Low Frequency Radio which can penetrate seawater but it needs enormous , long wire antennas. VLF has very long wavelengths.. need lots of wire!" "I got two cables at the correct angle for a VEE antenna and they fan out away from the business end, for miles." How many? "Well one leg is 37 miles and the other isn't quite so long at 35 miles." Do they need to be high? "Oh No!" Height doesn't seem to matter. We strung them out on poles which are eighteen feet high. 35 miles is hell of a distance." "Snag is we can't get at them if anything goes wrong!" Me "Why?" "Well the ice has closed in on them and they are now nearly 8 feet below the ice." I said "leave it with me.

Look at the graph of ocean heat content (down to 2,000 metres) and think again:<br /><a href="https://assets.rbl.ms/17125468/980x.png">https://assets.rbl.ms/17125468/980x.png</a><br />More than 90% of the additional heat absorbed due to global warming is absorbed into the oceans, so in many ways it is a more reliable indicator of global warming than the surface (or lower troposphere) temperatures more normally shown. On the other hand, we live on the Earth&#39;s surface, so the surface temperature changes are of more direct relevance to us.

Whether or not warming oceans are net releasers of CO2 depends not only on the amount of warming but also on what is happening to the partial pressure of CO2 above the oceans. Human activity (burning fossil fuels etc) is increasing the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere above the oceans sufficiently to cause the oceans to be net absorbers of CO2. Atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 ppmv in 1750 to 408 ppmv now. That's an increase of 45%, which at constant temperature would increase the concentration of CO2 in the ocean (at equilibrium) by the same percentage (Henry's Law). The very slight increase in temperature of the ocean surface (less than 1degC) will offset that to a slight extent (calculated via the van't Hoff equation), ie, the oceans will have absorbed slightly less than they would otherwise have done because of that temperature rise, but the overall result remains very much one that the oceans have been, and remain, net absorbers of CO2 since 1750. That is also why ocean acidity is increasing (thus far hydrogen ion concentration has increased by about 30% above pre-industrial levels.) How can the sun be warming the oceans when solar radiation is decreasing? It isn't.

I'm surprised you are not aware of that. The increase in CO2 is indeed at the expense of O2, simply because the burning of fossil fuels consumes oxygen in order to produce the CO2. IE the reaction is: C (from fossil fuel) + O2 (from atmosphere) => CO2 (in atmosphere initially at least) But since the amount of CO2 produced since 1750 would have been 202ppmv (if it had all stayed in the atmosphere), and the amount of oxygen remaining in the atmosphere is 209,500ppmv, the effect of that burning on oxygen levels is obviously very small (ie, we have caused a decline in oxygen levels of around 0.06% by burning fossil fuels). Of far greater concern is the increasing extent of anoxic (ie without oxygen) areas within the oceans, otherwise known as "dead zones". But they are caused by warming oceans and fertiliser/sewage run-off. That is a big problem. I recycle as much as possible of my own trash, and sometimes pick up and recycle other people's also. But I fail to see what that has to do with climate science.	UCFED0wWLtznE9v_Gkxb6uOg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFED0wWLtznE9v_Gkxb6uOg	1	Ugw21tvh7klo7SzFQZJ4AaABAg	Tengooda

The first is not established by any of of the references he gives above, and the second is so absurd and easily dismissed as to make anyone clinging to it appear very foolish. The first of Frolly's untruths is this: that plants stomatal records, acting as proxies for global atmospheric CO2 concentrations, establish that CO2 is NOT higher now than its been for millions of years. The second, absurd, assertion is "that atmospheric CO2 changes are caused by changes in global temperatures, not human emissions." I'll deal with the second of Frolly's false assertions first, with reference to the increase in atmospheric CO2 that has occurred over the last 250 years or so, since 1750. Apparently, Frolly (and Humlum whom he quotes) thinks that that increase has been caused by "changes in global temperatures". That is not only wrong, it is absurd, and this is why: The change was from about 280ppmv in 1750 to around 408ppmv now. That is an increase of 128ppmv. Now, 1ppmv of CO2 in the atmosphere represents 7.81 billion tonnes of CO2, (that is an entirely uncontroversial figure - you can look up the derivation) so an increase of 128ppmv represents an increase of 7.81 x 128 = 1000 billion tonnes of CO2: that is how much CO2 has accumulated in the Earth's atmosphere since 1750. So, how much CO2 have humans emitted to the atmosphere since 1750? We have records of fossil fuel burning and cement manufacture to 2014 here (in milions of tonnes of carbon): http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/ndp030/global.1751_2014.ems If you add up the total amount (and assume that 2015, 2016 and 2017 were similar to 2014), you will find that humans have emitted 430,000 million tonnes of C during that time, which equates to 430,000 x 44/12 = 1,580,000 million tonnes CO2, or 1,580 billion tonnes CO2. So, in summary, we have emitted 1,580 billion tonnes CO2, whilst the atmosphere has only increased by 1,000 billion tonnes CO2. In other words, we have emitted MORE THAN ENOUGH CO2 to fully account for the rise in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (the balance of 580 billion tonnes CO2 has been absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial biosphere and by weathering). In other words, we are responsible for the rise, and the oceans have been not ABSORBERS, not emitters, of CO2. The first of Frolly's false assertions concerned plant stomata. Stomata are a useful proxy, but they have inherent irreducible errors that must be considered, rather than just taking their results as gospel. Firstly, they represent the response of a living plant to an environmental change, and that response is not exact. Secondly, plants can ONLY respond to changes in CO2 levels where they are growing. If they are growing on peaty soils during a time of warming, then those soils may themselves be emitting CO2 (due to increased rates of rotting induced by the increased warmth), or if the plant is growing in area of rapid growth then CO2 levels my be reduced. Thus, stomatal records must be expected to have considerable errors associated with them, and these can be demonstrated when comparing such records with modern measurements from monitoring stations, such as Mauna Loa, that are deliberately sited in locations remote from source or sinks of CO2. Frolly relies for his false claim of CO2 levels above 400ppmv on this graph, taken from a PhD student's thesis (!!!): http://meteo.lcd.lu/globalwarming/Kouwenberg/co2_reconstruction_stomata.jpg Examine carefully the "changes" in atmospheric CO2 claimed in this graph around 500AD. According to the graph, CO2 increases from approximately 270ppmv in 320AD to 390ppmv in 420AD, an increase of 120ppmv, (representing 937 billion tons of CO2) in just 100 years! Where does that CO2 come from? Present volcanic emissions of CO2 are around 30 billion tonnes of CO2 per century, so volcanic activity would have had to increase by a factor of over 30 times just to produce that amount of CO2 (and more, for much would have been absorbed, as human emission have) . There is, of course, no evidence of such a vast increase in volcanic activity at that time. That is just one example of the kind of absurdities that arise if you "blindly believe the stomata record for CO2" (to borrow a phrase).

There is a 10-month lag between warming and any CO2 change, the change originates in the southern oceans, not in anthropogenic CO2 emission changes. There are many papers using stomata proxies in the literature which show CO2 varied dramatically over the last 2,000 years, thus directly disputing the monotonic ice core record. (Prof Salby explains why the ice core record is monotonic for CO2) These peer-reviewed papers were totally ignored by the IPCC in all its reports because they did not agree with the political story-line in the summary reports. Steinthorsdottir (2013) shows CO2 at 400ppm during the Younger Dryas. See; Steinthorsdottir, M., Wohlfarth, B., Kylander, M. E., Blaauw, M., & Reimer, P. J. (2013).

The CO2 record in most reconstructions has been spliced together from two different records; the ice-core proxy CO2 data and the Mona Loa atmospheric measurements of CO2. The records have plainly been forced to fit together from 1958 where they did not, in reality, match up. The Siple ice core data when un-adjusted showed 330ppm in 1891. Jaworowski has showed that the data was then shifted, without any good reason, 83 years forward to match up with Moana Loa data; http://www.goldenageproject.org.uk/downloads/scientific_paper_on_global_warming.pdf The most famous ice core, the Vostok (Antarctica) core, with air inclusions allegedly representing the global paleoatmospheres over the last 160,000 years, show CO2 levels below 200 ppmv for many tens of thousands of years spanning 30,000 to 110,000 years BP (Barnola et al., 1987).

After 1985, lower pre-industrial CO2 values were reported, and used as evidence for a recent man-made CO2 increase. The errors in these revised values, however, are of a similar magnitude to the apparent increase in atmospheric CO2 level. The assumptions used in estimating lower CO2 values in past atmospheres have been: no liquid phase in polar ice; younger age of air than of ice due to free gas exchange between deep firn and the atmosphere; and no change in composition of air inclusions. These assumptions are shown to be invalid. Liquid saline water exists in ice at low temperatures, even below ‚àí70¬∞C; airtight ice layers are ubiquitous in Antarctic firn; and more than 20 physico-chemical processes operating in situ and in ice cores contribute to the alteration of the chemical composition of air inclusions. The permeable ice sheet with its capillary liquid network acts as a sieve which redistributes elements, isotopes, and micro-particles. Thirty-six to 100% of air recovered from old ice is contaminated by recent atmospheric air during field and laboratory operations. The value of ‚àº290 ppm, widely accepted from glacier studies for the pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 level, apparently results from: invalid assumptions; processes in ice sheets; artifacts in ice cores; and arbitrary rejection of high readings. To date, glaciological studies are not able to provide a reliable reconstruction of either the CO2 level in pre-industrial and ancient atmospheres or paleoclimates. Instead these studies have led to a widely accepted false dogma of man-made climatic warming. This dogma may have enormous negative impact on our common future."

(It was very close to equilibrium because there had not been any very large change either in temperature or atmospheric CO2 during the previous centuries. It was not exactly at equilibrium because they had been some change in temperature and atmospheric CO2 during the previous centuries). Since that time the oceans have been absorbing CO2 as they adjust towards an ever receding new point of equilibrium (ever receding because we are continuing to add CO2 to the atmosphere). It would require several decades of no new human emissions of CO2 before a new equilibrium could be reached. The fundamental error you are making is thinking that at equilibrium the two media contain EQUAL concentrations of the solute. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. If you had bothered to take my advice an learn about this subject instead of continuing to make a fool of yourself with your ridiculous assertions, that fundamental fact would have become evident to you. Look up the details of ANY equilibria (eg bromine between benzene and water, or nitrogen between the oceans and the atmosphere) and you will find that the partition coefficients vary enormously and there are almost no instances where the solute is equally distributed between the two media. I say again: you are ignorant and confused and simply making a fool of yourself by refusing to go away and learn about this subject. Let go of your ego, admit your ignorance to yourself, and do yourself a favour and go away and learn some science, particularly about equilibria and partition coefficients.

Or you could try to understand the following: Firstly, partial pressure refers to gaseous mixtures, not solutions, so it is simply inappropriate to refer to partial pressure with respect to the ocean. But the main point is that, you clearly do not understand the subject of partition coefficients, which define the relative concentrations of a solute in two immiscible media at equilibrium. The equilibrium constant (or partition coefficient) is defined as the ratio of the solute concentrations in the two media at equilibrium (at a given temperature). Most frequently the two media can be a gas and a liquid, or two liquids. (You can't have two gases, because all gases are immiscible.) There are also solid/liquid and solid/solid partition coefficients that are of importance in geology and metallurgy. So, the equilibrium constant, K, gives the ratio of the concentrations of the solute in the two media, and for CO2 distributed between the oceans and the atmosphere at equilibrium then, using the (out of date - CO2 is now 0.041, but I'll use those figures anyway) figures in the waterencyclopedia that you found, (and assuming they represent equilibrium amounts) the equilibrium constant would be: K (CO2atm:ocean) = [CO2(atm)]/[CO2(ocean)] = 0.033/1.4 = 0.0236 (where [CO2] = concentration of CO2) and [CO2(ocean)] = [CO2(atm)]/0.0236 Thus, if [CO2(atm)] increases, then so does [CO2(ocean)] As I've said before, if you can't understand that, that is just too bad, I've wasted enough time on you. From you use of certain words, your foul insulting language, your arrogance and your scientific ignorance I have to assume you are yet another example of the appalling state of science education in the USA that is rapidly gaining the USA the status of contemptuous laughing stock throughout most of the rest of the educated world. I don't say that in anger, or as an insult, but in sadness, and as a warning. I was teaching this stuff probably before you were born, to students who were eager to learn (or at least tried to be!). The kind of retreat into arrogant scientific ignorance that you appear to represent is a huge danger to the world, and even more so to the USA.

As Silent Witness has already pointed out, your complaint is without foundation. Referring to a decrease in ocean pH as increasing acidity is not only correct, it is the most appropriate term since increasing acidity draws attention to the increase in hydrogen ion concentration and it is THAT species that is more directly involved in the reactions that cause problems for marine life, for example, the following equilibrium: CO3--(s) + H+(aq) <=> HCO3-(aq) whereby solid calcium carbonates, which makes up the shells of molluscs and the skeletons of corals, tends to be replaced by the soluble bicarbonate ion as hydrogen ion increases. It is not the reduction in hydroxide ion per se that causes that unfavourable trend.

I repeated it because it is correct (to a very good approximation - see comment on ideal vs real gases) and because you didn't understand it the first time round. I repeat again: Pa/Ptot = Na/Ntot, where Pa = partial pressure of gas a Ptot = the total pressure of the gas mixture containing gas a Na = the number of molecules of gas a in the mix, and Ntot = the total number of gas molecules in the mix. I expressed the concentration of atmospheric CO2 in ppmv (parts per million by volume). By Avagadro's Law, "by volume" of a gas is equivalent to "by number of molecules". So, if atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increase by 45%, then the number of CO2 molecules has increased by 45%, and thus the ratio Na/Ntot has increased by 45% and thus Pa/Ptot has increased by 45%, and thus partial pressure of CO2 has increased by 45%. If you can't understand that, it's just too bad. Curve Fitting: you obviously don't understand what that means. It is the searching for correlation over a limited time span between a phenomenon that you wish to explain (in this case the rise in global temperatures) and some other function. In your case it is finding a limited correlation between your ill-defined "sunspot integral" whilst ignoring the fact that the correlation breaks down outwith your limited time span (eg in the early 17th century) and without any explanation of how there can be a causative connection between the two variables based on physical reality. That is the very opposite of what climate scientists do: they establish a causative connection based on physical processes, make predictions based upon that hypothesis and THEN use correlation as a check on those predictions. As for your absurd Jonova graph: i) Jonava is not a climate scientist and she denies the reality of anthropogenic global warming. ii)Human CO2 EMISSIONS is the wrong metric to use if examining the greenhouse effect of CO2. The correct metric is atmospheric CO2 concentrations. They are NOT the same. iii) the claim in the graph that the warming rates from 1860 to 1880 and 1910 to 1940 are the same as 1975 to 2000 is FALSE, and easily shown to be so: http://www.woodfortrees.org/data/hadcrut4gl/from:1860/to:1880/trend/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1910/to:1940/trend/plot/hadcrut4gl/mean:12/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1970/to:2000/trend Rates of warming: 1860-1880 0.113degC/decade 1910-1940 0.127degC/decade 1975-2000 0.170degC/decade iv) such Jonova nonsense also, of course, makes no attempt to remove other factors that effect global temperatures and thus obscure the reality of such correlations that do exist. Jonova's graph is something designed by a fool to fool other fool's. Take a bow.	UCFED0wWLtznE9v_Gkxb6uOg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFED0wWLtznE9v_Gkxb6uOg	1	Ugw21tvh7klo7SzFQZJ4AaABAg	Tengooda

Your formula does not prove that. You are just making up nonsense. You warmists are curve-fitters too: http://jonova.s3.amazonaws.com/guest/de/temp-emissions-1850-ppt.jpg Yours is just worse.

Ugw21tvh7klo7SzFQZJ4AaABAg.8bvz-OG0BKL8c2msFj-ceZ		1	2018-01-30 17:47:17	Tengooda	Zoe claims, "the increase in concentration is not partial pressure". I didn't say, or imply, that it was. (Your sentence as it stands is almost meaningless) What I stated was that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by around 45% since 1750. That is correct. And I implied that that would cause an increase in the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere by the same amount. That is also correct to a very good approximation (approximate because CO2 and the other gases in the atmosphere are not ideal gases). But real gases approximate to ideal gases at low concentrations, and the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere even today is still "low" in that context, so the error is very small. That is simply a consequence of the definition of partial pressure, which for ideal gases is as follows: Pa/Ptot = Na/Ntot, where Pa = partial pressure of gas a Ptot = the total pressure of the gas mixture containing gas a Na = the number of molecules of gas a in the mix, and Ntot = the total number of gas molecules in the mix. No, London does not represent global temperatures, but the existence of frost fairs is frequently (and reasonably) cited as evidence for and a consequence of the Little Ice Age. I had intended simply to provide you with this compilation of graphs https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png It shows the same low temperatures in the early seventeenth century as implied by the frost fairs. But I thought you might have a tissy about being presented with a graph that included work by Michael Mann, as many folk of your persuasion do. I'm a gentleman. I was trying to be kind.

But the information I provided earlier (the 45% increase in partial pressure of CO2 versus the less than 1% rise in absolute temperature of the oceans) shows that the direction of change in the oceans is strongly that of CO2 absorption, and NOT emission, as you had falsely claimed. That direction, moreover, is confirmed by the increasing acidity of the oceans. I trust you now accept that the oceans are net absorbers of CO2. I see you are a fan of curve fitting. Curve fitting involves scrabbling around to find some function that appears, for a limited time at least, to correlate with with some phenomena that you wish to explain. It is then proclaimed as the cause of that phenomena, even though any explanation of the physics behind that causation is usually tenuous or non-existent. Thus it is with your vague and ill-defined "sunspot integral" shown in your graph: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wLCEUB9Aw28/U-cGLCEaBPI/AAAAAAAAGMQ/NAl4KtFKmog/s1600/sunspot+integral+2.jpg What you don't appear to have noticed is that your graph implies that global average temperatures in the early 17th century should have been similar to recent temperatures: yet they certainly were not. 1607, for example, saw the first of the "frost fairs" held upon the frozen Thames in London, which is frequently mentioned by those interested in the Little Ice Age as evidence of those frigid times. I suspect that, were the data available, you might also find that there is a reasonable correlation since 1850 between young ladies wearing oversized sun specs and global average temperatures, but claiming that the correlation is causal would be stretching matters somewhat. As for your kind enquiry into my drug taking habits, I'm afraid that all I can report is an over-indulgence in tea drinking whilst responding to Frolly's follies (with, on rare occasions, a daring indulgence in a cup of coffee), so if you're looking to get silly by hitting the harder stuff, I'm afraid I can't see a way to help you, though I'm sure it would be fun.

Do you think that LW (back-radiation) from CO2 also cannot heat rocks and soil? Because, indubitably, such radiation can penetrate such media even less than water, and is absorbed even more rapidly. If radiation is absorbed then the energy of the radiation is transferred from that electromagnetic radiation TO the medium that absorbs it, whether it does that over hundreds of metres, or only a few microns. That is what absorption means. When you sit in front of a fire and put your hands out, you feel them warmed by the infrared radiation coming from the fire. That radiation is likewise absorbed within a tiny distance in your skin. Yet according to Frolly that tiny distance of absorption would mean that your hands aren't being warmed at all. And, of course, even if we didn't understand HOW that energy is being absorbed (we do) it is still a matter of observation that it IS being, because the oceans are, also indubitably, warming up. Cheng and Zhu, Chinese Academy of Science, report that the heat content anomaly (relative to 1981-2010) of the top 2,000m of the oceans has changed thus over the last five years: 2017: 19.19 √ó 10^22 J 2016: 17.18 √ó 10^22 J 2015: 17.68 √ó 10^22 J 2014: 16.74 √ó 10^22 J 2013: 16.08 √ó 10^22 J	UCFED0wWLtznE9v_Gkxb6uOg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFED0wWLtznE9v_Gkxb6uOg	1	Ugw21tvh7klo7SzFQZJ4AaABAg	Tengooda

Not surprisingly, Ham Radio is his hobby and keeps in touch with home. "What you working on?" says I foolishly. "Can't tell you much but we're expanding a system which is known WW.and no secret there. We are developing Very Low Frequency Radio which can penetrate seawater but it needs enormous , long wire antennas. VLF has very long wavelengths.. need lots of wire!" "I got two cables at the correct angle for a VEE antenna and they fan out away from the business end for miles." How many? "Well one leg is 37 miles and the other isn't quite so long at 35 miles." Do they need to be high? "Oh No!" Height doesn't seem to matter. We strung them out on poles which are eighteen feet high. 35 miles is hell of a distance." "Snag is we can't get at them if anything goes wrong!" Me "Why?" "Well the ice has closed in on them and they are now nearly 8 feet below the ice." I said "leave it with me.

As a Radio Ham, I have been directly involved in Sunspots etc since the late 50s. The 11 year peaks have diminished every time since 58 which was a big one..I think that 46/7 was even bigger but I was too young to care. I watched and used each cycle, cussing at the minima because Radio propagation deteriorated with each one. Also each maximum diminished and in the last three, Radio noticeably declined with the poor peaks. We just this year dropped into the minimum of Cycle 24 but the peak had been so an√¶mic that it is suggested that we may well, not emerge from this minimum into Cycle 25. If that occurs, it will echo the pattern of the cycles which led into the Maunder Minimum which remained dormant for 70/80 years and the Sp√∂rer & Dalton Minima which were not quite so long but were bad enough, creating the very Mini Ice Ages to which you refer. That was when the Thames & I'm sure other rivers, froze over to a depth of (guess) ten feet..certainly thick enough to hold winter Fairs on the Ice. Some years were described as 'The Years when Summer forgot to come!" Big problem..crops, livestock, food shortages & riots. Pity this Global Warming lark is a phony. We could burn more fossilised fuel and reduce the severity. Don't know about Global warming... You wanna buy some thick socks and scarf?

T2LT represents the lower troposphere and is a weighted mean, with the largest weights from the surface to 350 hPa (mean altitude 2.5 km), T2 corresponds to the mid-troposphere with weights extending from the surface to 70 hPa (mean altitude 6.1 km) and T4 corresponds to the lower stratosphere with weights extending from 120 to 20 hPa (mean altitude of 17 km). Here we will be considering only T2LT and T2. We include, also, the T2 results of Vinnikov et al.

Yes the ice is receding and it has been for tens of thousands of years. However, just in the last couple of decades we were told waters would rise, polar bears would disappear, phytoplankton would die and in so doing would kill off other species, etc.. Well, (clears throat) phytoplankton increased by 31% just in 2003-2013, but they moved further north. The wildlife is more abundant so all the way up to the polar bears have been increasing in numbers and are healthier. The issue that alarmists have is that what is occurring goes against everything that they believed. It is as if they WANT the worst case scenario to occur in order to prove themselves right. Mass migrations in order to adapt to ever changing climates has always been a partt of life. So has mass die offs in incredible numbers of species and individuals that did not adapt.

Who said CO2 need to be lower than 400ppm, because nobody knows. What we know is when we inject co2 in a green house the plant thrives, they grow faster and bigger. More CO2 = more food. How can this be bad? If you think low CO2 and cold is better think again. If this was the case people would cut more trees to heat and cook, less trees would mean less oxygen. When CO2 was 2000ppm life on the planet didn't disappear, it thrive. People died because of ice age, cold and freezing is the biggest life killer, not co2 and warm whether. What if the medieval warm was created by man by injecting more CO2 by cutting all the trees down to cook and produce metal tool, coins and shelter. In return it created less oxygen. This would happen again if you stop using fossil fuel, people would start cutting trees down to heat and cook. With fossil fuel you keep balance, no need to cut the trees down, you get the warm wether, more food and all the oxygen you need, maybe we could prevent a mini ice age...Just saying.

Today, entropy has increased and the universe is much more complex and in much greater disorder because entropy only increases Early humans lived a simple hunter gatherer life that was much more simple than today&#39;s life. Maybe entropy also rules the affairs of humans? If so, there will be more of this disarray and dispute about such things as whether man is causing the climate to warm. Entropy is only about decay but will humans recognize that and try to at least delay or slow down the journey to decay? Any human who is pursuing this windmill of man made warming is speeding entropy but, alas, these Don Quixotes may not be able to stop themselves.

Entropy ultimately has everything to do with climate because one day there will be no climate . It is not logical to ignore solar cycles and alter temp data to create a fairy tale of man made CO2 warming. Once upon a time, science believed radioactive elements like radium had a positive health benefit that was sort of backwards - reminds me of preparing for global warming when cooling is the more likely scenario. Scientists should spend more time on determining what is consciousness and whether it is affected by entropy. There is a whole lot of shouting going on - people who say it is settled - 97% of all scientists agree. Go ahead....tilt at that windmill.

It's a very complicated system and over millions of years it changes from one equilibrium to the next. Millions of years ago there was much more CO2 is the air than there is now. There is geological evidence of this. Some of the geology of that time created a resource called fossil fuels that we can dig out of the ground and use to power the modern world. As we turn this massive amount of fuel back into gas it will change this equilibrium. First much of this gas will disolve into the ocean and make the water measurably more acidic. This has happened. When the oceans have absorbed whatever CO2 that they can easily absorb then the C02 will remain in the air and cause less of the energy that comes from the sun each day to escape into space. This in turn will effect the equilibrium. As the Earth warms other sources of CO2 it the sea floor and in the permanent frost in the Arctic will be released, increasing the effect, and will cause a runaway warming that we have no power to stop. As previously habitable regions of the Earth become uninhabitable the populations of the world will migrate or die	UChnHhhO1Lr2SzKsznFUE1GA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChnHhhO1Lr2SzKsznFUE1GA	1	Ugxl70tETWjFHxsE1VZ4AaABAg	J Henry Phillips

This is the problem when you have the same people that collect the data, determine the corrections, and then create the models, also have their funding based on finding a problem. There is very little funding if there is no concern of major catastrophe, so they are obviously very motivated to find a problem. Whereas these retired scientists have no reason for bias, they are only interested in scientific truth. I think most of these alarmist know that man made climate change is a hoax, but they do not care as long as it gives lots of money for them, and their research. I think they see it as a means to an end, so in their minds the deception is justified. Unfortunately there is a very real human cost to what they are doing, but like any dogmatic religion, they see this as some higher calling. So if millions end up suffering and dying, well that is just to bad. Listen to what these men are saying. Have any of these alarmist directly refuted their arguments with actual scientific data? Not that I have seen, in fact they go out of their way to avoid even getting into these discussions, They just try to shout down these scientist with ridiculous ad hominem attacks.

I am not going to support turning mother earth into a science experiment just because some aging scientists say it is ok. Not much is lost if the consensus is hyperbole and we mitigate CO2 emissions to stay under 2 C by 2100, and a lot is lost if they underestimate the consequences and we keep the status quo. <br /><br />Since renewables and sustainable energies are continuing to become more affordable, I will play it cautiously and say we need to phase out the old fossil fuel technology. At some point in the near future it will be more affordable to go renewable/sustainable anyway, why not play it safe. Colorado is having a lot of success with solar, and I got solar panels earlier this year. So far, the only issue I have with them is that some of my trees are shading some of the panels. So I need to get them trimmed.<br /><br />Am I going to believe 25 retired NASA scientists rehashing the same old claims that have been debunked or rely on the following organizations which say AGW is the highest probability of what is happening? This is simple risk analysis that any responsible citizen would use. <br /><br />You have 25 retirees, who will not be alive in 2100 and I have the following organizations that support AGW.

I can answer some of your questions indirectly by listing the 5 major extinctions. We can assume abundant life before these extinctions. Sometimes it is hard to find good links, so providing them here. *Extinction 1* *When* : End Ordovician - 444 million years ago *Cause* : Short severe ice age that lowered sea levels. Newly exposed silicate rock sucked out CO2 from the atmosphere, freezing the planet. *Damage* : 86% of species lost *Extinction 2* *When* : End Devonian- 375 million years ago *Cause* : ? *Damage* : 75% of species lost. Trilobites survived the 1st mass extinction, not the 2nd *Extinction 3* *When* : End Permian- 251 million years ago *Cause* : A collision of natural catastrophes. Huge volcano eruption near Siberia, blasting huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Methanogenic bacteria responds with the release of methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Global temperatures swelled, the pH of the oceans dropped and started belching hydrogen sulfide. Rocks after this period record no coral reefs or coal deposits. Pretty much set back life for 300 million years. Worst extinction. *Damage* : 96% of species lost. *Extinction 4* *When* : End Triassic- 200 million years ago *Cause* : Unknown cause. *Damage* : 80% of species lost. *Extinction 5* *When* : End Cretaceous - 66 million years ago *Cause* : Dinosaurs roamed the land during Cretaceous while ammonites dominated the oceans. Volcanic activity and climate change were putting the Ammonites under stress. Then an asteroid hit and wiped out the dinosaurs. The ammonites oldest surviving relative is the Nautilus. *Damage* : 76% of species lost. To find when temperatures were similar to current global temperatures refer to the link below which I use often, called "Temperature of Planet Earth". Assuming the year 2000 on the graph an moving in a straight line to the left you get temperatures exceeding present about 100,000 years ago. You get huge peaks in temperatures around 50 million years ago with large jumps between 100 to 500 million years ago. *Factoid* Humans have been around only 200,000 years. *Factoid* The fluctuation in temperature from high to low during the Pleistocene between glacial and interglacial periods is only about 5 C. See the chart. There is a dip in temperature at about 20,000 years then it slowly stabilizes until the beginning of 1880. *Factoid* Last time CO2 levels were similar to current levels was about 3 million years ago during the Pliocene. It was about 365 to 410 ppm for thousands of years. Arctic temperatures were 11 to 16 C warmer. Global temperatures over this period are estimated to be 3 to 4 C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures. Sea levels were about 25 meters higher than current sea level. *Factoid* During periods of high CO2 (3000 ppm or more) the earth also experienced glaciations. The Solar output was also lower (4%) during these times. *References* Temperature of Planet Earth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_temperature_record 2.4 Our Geologic Backdrop: Ice Age Cycles https://youtu.be/4iPxDR-yaWM?list=PLAHtWWrZTgn-i_U-ft6cjsTj2faylPSJO 2.5 Climate Change in the Recent Past https://youtu.be/-W5wgReG5Vc?list=PLAHtWWrZTgn-i_U-ft6cjsTj2faylPSJO 3.1 Energy from the Sun and Earth https://youtu.be/zsVkfxjaezk?list=PLAHtWWrZTgn8boLKB4-a1PV5y_u_b0MJU Pleistocene https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene Ancient CO2 Levels https://youtu.be/aqkGoCglp_U The Keeling Curve (goes back 800,000 years, CO2 never was higher than present) https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/ The Big Five Mass Extinctions https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontology/big-five-extinctions Milankovich Cycles http://www.sciencecourseware.org/eec/GlobalWarming/Tutorials/Milankovitch/	UC-PBKThSoJ197HvQHTLTubw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-PBKThSoJ197HvQHTLTubw	1	UgxyyPIQj-yVwpK-SK54AaABAg	Jeff Segor

I am a software developer but I can put logical concepts together pretty well if I have good sources. Go to the websites of any of the 40+ institutions I listed above and you will find plenty of people with science degrees, some with multiple degrees. That's where I get my sources. And I have two playlists, one pro AGW and one skeptical of AGW that I refer to, for convenience. And I have an archive of 3 full online classes I refer to - two of which I have completed - the other had a bit too many partial differential equations for my taste but good videos. And finally, I have a database with almost 500 good links on Climate Change covering pro and con arguments which you can search on. Many are scientific research articles. From that, I come to the most plausible and probable conclusion. Should be sufficient for a layman like me, since I am a busy man with many interests.

See the link below on what is happening with the ozone layer. The reduction of ozone-depleting substances due to the Montreal Protocol is actually working. Montreal Protocol has been a success https://www.facebook.com/NASAClimateChange/videos/10156180820467139/ We have also restricted asbestos and other carcinogenic substances with much success as we learn their detrimental effects when entered into the environment or foods. CO2 is in a similar category. It is not a poison but can have adverse effects when upsetting the carbon cycle balance which has been established over thousands of years. The excess atmospheric CO2 due to fossil fuel emissions has been demonstrated by many researchers to have a definite human fingerprint on it. The fact that its amount is small compared to the input and output of CO2 due to natural causes is quite irrelevant. The amount of a substance is not the issue, its the sensitivity to that substance that matters. I can have a lot of peanut butter but my friend who is allergic can't have even a small amount if his body is highly sensitive. The crux of the issue is just how sensitive is the earth to the amount of emissions we are sending into the environment. If we stopped cold the CO2 emissions today, the temperature will probably still rise since there is a lag time before an equilibrium can be established. Also for those who say it is the temperature precedes CO2 increases, then these people have to prove what is really causing the increase in global mean temperature and it boils down to a finite set of other forcings: Earth's orbit, tilt, etc. Solar irradiation Internal Variability, e.g. PDO, AMO, El Nino, La Nina Volcanoes Each of these 4 can be ruled out AS THE PRIMARY FORCING IN RECENT TIMES and there are substantial research papers on this. Earth's orbit/tilt happens over huge ranges in time very slowly. The rate of current warming is too fast. Solar irradiation is actually going down in the short term, and only gradually going up in the long term. Internal variability tends to just redistribute heat rather than force it. And extant volcanoes emit a very small amount of CO2 in comparison to fossil fuel emissions and sometimes they have a cooling effect as well. Also, scientists can tell that the excess CO2 is coming from our emissions because of the ratio of C12/C13 in the atmosphere points in that direction. The cooling of the upper atmosphere is characteristic of CO2, not increase sun radiation. These are based on empirical observations, not models. The article below shows 10 indicators and there are many more.

If that is so then reducing CO2 emissions (especially at the great estimated cost involved) is nothing more than "feel good" activity. Your argument about playing it safe is only valid if you know the action you are about to take will in fact work....and that is exactly what you don't know regarding reducing CO2 emissions.

Forgot about my old friend Blaise Pascal and his wager. Indeed, there is a truth that I am using that kind of argument. We don't have a lot to lose assuming what virtually all major academies and institutions worldwide believe in AGW to varying degrees. I wouldn't say that I believe the outcome would be necessarily catastrophic with status quo since humans have a knack for adapting and surviving. But many things we cherish today, at least by biologists, may not survive the temperature delta. I used to keep tons of aquariums and I know that optimal conditions for breeding were a very narrow range of water temperatures and pH and even soft vs. hard water chemistry. I follow many oceanographers on twitter and the rate of change is the concern for many coral reefs around the world. If we could make major strides in carbon sequestration and CCS, then we may be able to have our cake and eat it. But until that time, I have to stay on the side of mitigation and conservation. It reminds me of our resistance to address the National Debt, except adopting solar, wind, geothermal, and other technologies is a lot more interesting than paying down the debt. Ultimately someone is going to pay the price of doing little or nothing based on overwhelming evidence. That being said, I still stand by my "False Analogy". Pascal was talking about faith in God, and taking the safe route in the afterlife, probably out of trying to make a joke. The evidence is so overwhelming for AGW that it comes down to probabilities and risk assessment. We cannot risk taking the path of a tiny number of self-appointed contrarians, most of which are too old to personally experience the results of doing nothing for the sake of short-term gain. Each year and decade, the physical evidence for AGW gets stronger, just by looking at the number of scientific papers out there with increasingly accurate models. The sustainable energy model is the future and will be adopted - period. The cost of fossil fuels will not be able to compete with the new renewable/sustainable energy technology breakthroughs. Some believe this may start happening as soon as 2020, just in time for an administration turnover in the White House. And it can all happen with just a pen and a phone. 1.1 Framing the climate change conversation https://youtu.be/l3d4Uj-N03k	UC-PBKThSoJ197HvQHTLTubw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-PBKThSoJ197HvQHTLTubw	1	UgxyyPIQj-yVwpK-SK54AaABAg	Jeff Segor

We are not talking about stopping the use of fossil fuels cold, just budget them to stay in the safe range and crank up the alternative energy resources. Kind of what we are doing with CFCs and related emissions. Phase out coal quickly in favor of natural gas, then crank up the sustainable energies. Retrain coal workers for the other industries. Probably a lot more fun than hanging out in mines. My information tells me that dropping a mere 5 C global mean temperature can launch an ice age, so it doesn't take much rise or fall of global temperatures to have a dramatic effect. Also, when was the last time in history did we have a CO2 concentration of 408 ppm or higher? Kind of a long ago. In the Keeling Curve, notice the curve is not linear but accelerating. I don't think I have seen any credible source that says increasing CO2 will lower global mean temperatures. Maybe Alex Jones can send me some links.

Of course there is some AGW but whether we CAN do anything about it is quite another matter isn't it. So reducing emissions is not, as you seem to think, playing it safe.

We could use the same argument in ignoring CFCs and the ozone layer. Or that dangerous intersection where there were more and more accidents and fatal ones at that, but still the contrarians did not want to put up a traffic light to mitigate the problems. My analogy is better than your Satan one. Put up the damn light, sure it will be an expense, but not compared to not doing it. It's called risk management. The AGW stance is akin to vaccinating my child or not. I will take the risk of the vaccination since there is a higher probability it will protect than not. The deeper I learn about the climate science and listen to all the arguments on both sides, the AGW side is the most probable and convincing with very little to lose by switching energies. Heck, I am 80% already there as an individual. Virtually every contrarian argument can be debunked. Remove all the cherry-picking and strawman arguments and the contrarians are not left with much - "eh, it ain't so bad, relax". Clean energy, clean water. Isn't that what POTUSVSG said? It all comes down to one thing: climate sensitivity. The rest is noise.	UC-PBKThSoJ197HvQHTLTubw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-PBKThSoJ197HvQHTLTubw	1	UgxyyPIQj-yVwpK-SK54AaABAg	Jeff Segor

Although each presenter will be adequately refuted on the opposing side by those more scientifically qualified than I, let me take a moment to comment on just one aspect of their message.<br /><br />It is evident that they are not as concerned with the science that they so vehemently deride as they are with what they see as an assault on their christian fundamentalist right-wing conservative political ideology! They have no qualms about squandering the earth&#39;s resources to satisfy their religious and political vanities, and their greed for fossil fuel dollars, while dragging down the pursuit of science, real science, in the process. Regardless of what they think about climate science, the world is in peril, and anything that we can do to ameliorate the problem requires serious consideration by all the world&#39;s peoples. It has been estimated that there were about 1 billion people on the earth 200 years ago. Today, there are 7.5 billion people and that is projected to grow to 11.5 billion or so by 2100. Tell me humans do not have an impact on climate. Population growth is rising along with atmospheric temperatures, ocean temperatures and ocean levels, including those in all the presentations in this video. Even in their vain attempts to show otherwise with their pseudoscience, in the end they agree with mainstream science on that.<br /><br />It is sad to see such eminent men lower themselves to the level of people like Patrick Moore, Tim Ball and Christopher Monckton after such distinguished careers in their respective fields.

However, I am comfortable in my "religious world view" that climate science is best left to climate scientists and not the charlatans of the Heartland Institute and the paid lackeys of the fossil fuel industry. As a better commentator than I has said many times, all these gentlemen that deride real science need to do is read and understand the scientific literature that they are so quick to denigrate or, "Do the science!" Perhaps they are too busy with other endeavors to do either but they should at least make the effort for you, don't you think?

"To discover, develop, and promote free-market solutions to social and economic problems." It is a Republican think tank that seeks smaller government. As it relates to climate change, they seek to gut and/or muzzle various government agencies dealing with the issue of climate change in order to protect the Republican's money base, primarily the fossil fuel industry.

Pseudo-scientists misinterpreting that data to misinform. The gentlemen in this video are way in over their heads when it comes to the science of climate change. But that's not what they are there for. They are there to promote the christian fundamentalist's right-wing agenda in concert with the fossil fuel industry. In other words, a propaganda campaign, a cover, for the Republican Party, to help out their corporate donors by misleading the country and deflecting criticism from them. They have become the Party of anti-science and the Heartland Institute their unapologetic cheerleaders.

Let me just take one aspect: you claim: "roughly 5% of CO2 is man made. [...] We evolved at 3000ppm". Neither of those statements is correct. The change in atmospheric CO2 over the last 10,000 years is shown here: https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/co2_10k.png as you can see, there has been a sudden increase in atmospheric CO2 in the last century or so, after thousands of years of little change, which strongly suggestive of human activity. In 1750 atmospheric CO2 was about 280ppmv. It is now about 408ppmv. That is an increase of c.45%. Records have been kept of how much fossil fuels have been burnt, and thus how much CO2 has been produced, since 1750. Those records are here: http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/ndp030/global.1751_2014.ems They show that the amount of CO2 from human burning of fossil fuels is MORE THAN ENOUGH to account for the increase from 280 to 408ppmv -some (about half) of the human emitted CO2 has been absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial biosphere and soils. It is also wrong to claim that humans evolved when CO2 was at 3,000ppmv. Atmospheric CO2 levels are now higher than they have been for several million years (possibly as long as 15 million years), and CO2 has not been as high as 3,000 ppmv for at least 100 million years, and probably around 400 million years. Humans evolved in the last million years or so (depending on exactly how you define "human").

On the one side you have those scientists who do the science and conclude that the warming trend is due to an increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere along with other factors but that it can be slowed by cutting back on emissions. On the other side we have mostly amateurs (backyard mechanic types) defined as being, "attached to a particular pursuit, study, or science.... without pursuing it professionally" That covers those I mentioned above - Moore, Monckton and Ball. As for the gentlemen in the video, who attempt to speak with authourity and conviction on a topic for which they have no scientific background, it is truly difficult to watch. Tom Wysmuller and Dr Hal Doiron use composite graphs of dubious provenance which all show show upwards trends for everything related to climate change. The only contentious issues they present are minor differences from the accepted science. The saddest point in all this was listening to Walter Cunningham. His talk sounded like a plea for a propaganda war against the opposition. He tries to sound convincing when he says at min. 45.19 that the climate alarmists' rhetoric is based on, "emotions and politics". I like to think it's based on science, not the misguided right wing political agenda of the Heartland Institute and the fossil fuel industry.

Find out who is and why there getting paid then determine if theres a bias when u read their articles! I agree and wish religion and so called AGW weren't political but they are. Greed and Petroleum dollars, big oil, i agree as well, SCUMBAGS. Oil should be 25 cents a litre, its $1.25 here west coast Canada and the earth is NOT running out of it, ¬†we've been fed that bullshit from day one. Crude oil might not even be a fossil fuel. It might be mineral based produced from heat and pressure at the earths core. Its the second most abundant liquid on earth, thats another story ! Ell Bee, our CO2 emissions have NO significant effect on our climate. CO2 is NOT a pollutant. The real data is out and available. Don't let these big numbers, tons of human emissions. Don't equate much significance to them, they barely register in comparison to what mother nature produces. I believe roughly 5% of CO2 is man made. Truth is we need more. We evolved at 3000ppm were presently at 400ppm . Satellite data shows we have a greener earth in the past 30 years equated to rising CO2. Heres an interesting fact in terms of numbers. The sun fuses 600 million tons of hydrogen per SECOND. Has been for 4.5 billion years has roughly 4 billion more to go ! Don't let these media scientists WOW you with big numbers and cherry picked even fraudulent data .¬† Theres nothing that compares in energy density to petrol. So called renewables are really not. there expensive, break down and are and will remain very costly. Denying the third world access to the very thing that made us rich, lengthened our lives and gave us the comfort that we have is not only unfair its unethical ! ¬†The 3 names you mentioned above happen to be very respected . I hope you can find that out. ¬†One of which is Tim Ball who is being sued by Michael Mann. Why not spend some time and search the facts about Mann's "hockey stick graph" climate gate, Search the Oregon petition, the global warming swindle! You might be shocked and if you do you will definitely want Lord Monckton on your team. He's one thick skinned individual!

Of course it isn't. But then no-one ever said it was. Under rare circumstances, people DROWN in CO2, but obviously, you could drown in water, or custard, or treacle. But the fact that CO2 isn't TOXIC doesn't mean it's not dangerous. If you want to argue that we can pump all the CO2 we like into the air, then you will have to discount the idea that it's a greenhouse gas. The consensus seems to be that it is. Obviously there have been times in the distant past when our atmosphere had very high levels of CO2. On the other hand, there have been times in our distant past when there have been mass extinctions. So ... honestly I'm not sure what you're arguing. You think it's OKAY that our major cities have dangerous levels of pollution? It's not JUST CO2 that comes out of exhaust pipes. There's also a cocktail of diesel particulates, Carbon MONoxide, and NO so... what are you saying ... that these gases (definitely toxic) are okay? Do you actually have a 'CO2 doesn't cause warming' argument, or is this the old 'CO2 is plant food' assertion that ignores the entire issue? I'm genuinely not sure what you are trying to say.

During my visits to Beijing, China, Chaing Mai, Thailand, London, England, San Francisco, U.S.A., the pollution was so thick that you could barely see across the road and breath freely. As a retired scientist, I feel obliged to inform citizens that Co2 is a colorless, odorless gas. The fine particles and other chemicals that accompany the Co2 in the atmosphere are proven to cause severe effects in the aspirational process and behavior of the bodies of all human (Homo Sapiens), animal, and plant life. Yes, a major cause for concern. Many "Blame Co2", however, the crew of submarines and spacecraft survive comfortably in Co2 levels of 2,000 ppm to 7,000 ppm often at 5,000 ppm for weeks and months. The Co2 levels in normal office buildings are often recorded at 1,200 to 2,000 ppm. Fact Checked. The fanatical, often hysterical demonizing of Co2 is promoted by uneducated, activists and extremists is regarded as unsubstantiated rubbish by CREDIBLE SCIENTISTS. Please conduct your own research and search Co2 levels in submarines and spacecraft to confirm these comments. Kindest regards.

This bears out exactly what you said, right? Well this is what the Trump administration is up to RIGHT NOW to reverse this obviously beneficial situation: ‚Ä¢ In December, Scott Pruitt issued a memo reducing the chances an energy plant will have to abide by stricter air quality standards if it initially miscalculates its future pollutant emissions. ‚Ä¢ In January, Pruitt issued a memo [reclassifying] "major" sources of air pollution can once again be reclassified as "minor" polluters and, therefore, able to escape tough clean air regulations. ‚Ä¢ In April, President Trump issued a directive, giving metropolitan areas "flexibility" to meet [air quality targets. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¶ the administration is expected to formally lay out a plan revisiting strict fuel-economy standards https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/31/moves-relax-clean-air-rules-trump-administration-praises-law/873612002/ Your clean air is under attack.

I'm English and it's true that things LOOK a whole lot cleaner now. First we had clean air acts which prohibited the burning of high-sulphur coal, which did away with the deadly smog, particularly in London. Then we had access to gas from the North Sea, which encouraged people to use efficient gas fires and boilers. Coupled with this, we have all but lost our steel and metal-bashing industries, so there a good deal of industrial pollution has been exported to other countries. But the modern curse is traffic. There are busy streets in London and Birmingham (England) in which it's literally dangerous to walk if you are susceptible to asthma. It is estimated that something like 40 000 UK people per year die prematurely because of air pollution - most of which is car/truck related. Estimates are difficult to verify of course, but if this is anywhere near the truth, then this is a shocking number (would we ignore it if 40 passenger jets a year were crashing in one smallish country?) So, yeh,everything LOOKS cleaner, but nitrous oxide, , Carbon monoxide and diesel particulates are invisible, unlike soot and smoke. I imagine that it's the same in America, and that while the buildings of NY and LA are not actually blackened by smoke, their residents are probably suffering many respiratory problems caused by cars and trucks.

There have to be something else giving us this habitable temperature. If the sun is such a key driver of the Earth‚Äôs climate, then why has the entire planet (air, oceans, land, and ice) warmed rapidly over the past 60 years while solar activity has declined? If the warming were caused by a more active sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. "According to PMOD at the World Radiation Center there has been no increase in solar irradiance since at least 1978, when satellite observations began. This means that for the last thirty years, while the temperature has been rising fastest, the sun has not changed. https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d362a8c557fffd7e78bc52ad16731b13 http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=tsi/composite/SolarConstant http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2008/03/not-much-warming-under-sun https://qr.ae/TUGAeB	UCDZIzkBJ84FQzUtb-Jnf96Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDZIzkBJ84FQzUtb-Jnf96Q	1	UgxMXWq13hUjgQDXIrl4AaABAg	ROY cracker

It's observations ,and every fucking data from oceans, weather stations and satellites shows the same fucking warming trend. https://qr.ae/TUnm1D And: The carbon in the atmospheric CO2 contains information about its source, so that scientists can tell that fossil fuel emissions comprise the largest source of the increase since the pre-industrial era. The carbon from burning fossil fuels have a different isotope signal (radioactivity) than C02 coming from natural sources. Its like a fingerprint. Its unique.

"But Dad," he protested, "I didn't kill any ants... the sun did it!" It didn't work then and it doesn't work now. Several million in funding and a paid army of sockpuppets, and a pathetically small pool of "scientists" willing to sell their children's souls for a buck or two notwithstanding, Heartland's campaign of disgraceful deceit will not go unchallenged. Speaking of which, how has the ROI been recently when looking at dollars allocated for manufacturing consent? Getting a bit more expensive recently? Could it be that there are actors in play here that you never realized were in the game? Brownian motion indeed. Is is possible that some have a better view because they stand on your shoulders and you simply haven't noticed? Consider these questions every 6 months or so and observe how your answers change. Sometimes the answers hide right in front of your nose but you look right past them. In astrophysics, black holes are recognized and located by observing their effects on the things around them. But if you believe black holes don't exist, you never even bother to look. Just a thought.

It began at the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago. For about 6000 years we have moved slowly towards the next ice age. And since the 70's, the energy and heat of the sun have been decreasing; The lower parts of the atmosphere is getting warmer, the outer part is getting cooler. A very clear human fingerprint. Compare the slow, natural cooling with the sudden warming that started with the industrial revolution. Do you think there is a reason why the changes we see now are up to 20 times as rapid and in the opposite direction of the slow natural cooling trend? Natural cycles can only move heat around, as heat exchange within the oceans or from the oceans to the atmosphere. But now we see adding of heat both in oceans and the atmosphere. So the adding of heat to the energy budget we see now must come from somewhere else than natural cycles. This is the scary part: THE HUMAN INFLUENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE IS SO STRONG WE ARE MAKING THE PLANET RAPIDLY WARM IN A TIME WHEN IT SHOULD BE SLOWLY COOLING!! The planet needs stability. The ecosystems cant adapt to rapid changes. Compare it to your own body temperature. Just a small drop or raise in body temperature will cause us problems, pain - or worse. The effects of today's global warming are felt by societies and existing ecosystems adapted to the Holocene climate in OUR TIME - NOT the climate and CO2 levels that existed hundreds of millions of years ago. The earth should have become slowly cooler now. But instead, we see very rapid warming, in the OPPOSITE direction of the natural slow cooling trend. We see ocean level rise, and the sea is getting warmer, the surface temperatures are getting higher, the Greenland ice is melting, the Arctic sea ice melts, even in Antarctica there is a record low on ice. It can only be one explanation; Human influence is now the dominant factor for climate change. "According to PMOD at the World Radiation Center there has been no increase in solar irradiance since at least 1978, when satellite observations began. This means that for the last thirty years, while the temperature has been rising fastest, the sun has not changed. http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=tsi/composite/SolarConstant "Don't blame the sun for recent global warming. A new analysis, based on historical data rather than computer simulations, shows that our star's role in climate change has been vastly overtaken by other factors, particularly the human-induced buildup of greenhouse gases." http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2008/03/not-much-warming-under-sun This ‚Äòimpending mini ice age‚Äô myth is incredibly easy to debunk. In fact it just takes asking one simple question ‚Äì if the sun is such a key driver of the Earth‚Äôs climate, then why has the entire planet (air, oceans, land, and ice) warmed rapidly over the past 60 years while solar activity has declined? https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jul/16/no-the-sun-isnt-going-to-save-us-from-global-warming	UCDZIzkBJ84FQzUtb-Jnf96Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDZIzkBJ84FQzUtb-Jnf96Q	1	UgxMXWq13hUjgQDXIrl4AaABAg	ROY cracker

However, your point of reasoning and let us make no mistake, it IS a very good one, applies to the bulk of the mysterious IPPCC 97%, many of whom are not in the appropriate discipline, were often sub Msc. and lower, let alone PhD and were given the theory for which to find the proof, on promise of a fee. What are they going publish? Disproof of the theory? Many report trying fruitlessly to withdraw from the 97%. Science is the intensive study of a subject, compilation of data, comparison of data from other sources and then the forming of a theory. Like your excellent posting, claimants for Global Warming, which had to be altered to Climate Change when it was found that there WAS none, argued by clever word plays which are hard to gainsay, somewhat akin to "Have you stopped beating your wife?"

We learned all about the different greenhouse gases in year one. It's pretty basic stuff and none of it is a revelation. The fact is that CO2 is nothing but a trace gas in the atmosphere and contributes a very small amount to the greenhouse effect compared with say, water vapor. It's impossible to perform concrete experiments on this issue to determine the exact level of contribution of each different component of the atmosphere because the various layers of the atmosphere are so complex and vast, so at this point you really just need to make your own judgment call. Would you logically expect that a change in concentration of CO2 in the air from about 0.027% to say, at the extreme, 0.05%, would cause global climate catastrophe? If you decide that at the least, this change could warm the earth by a few degrees celsius, the second question you need to think about carefully is this. Historically, have warm periods on the earth resulted in mass extinction, widespread famine and global catastrophic climate change? There is plenty of evidence that demonstrates the exact opposite but I am not aware of any period where there was 'thermal runaway' of the earth or any warm period where biodiversity suffered. However I am open to new information. If anyone is aware of any research or data that suggests that a warm period has caused mass death and destruction, I would genuinely be interested in reading about it.

Surfing the net one finds "The atmosphere of Venus is made up almost completely of carbon dioxide. Nitrogen exists in small doses, as do clouds of sulfuric acid. The air of Venus is so dense that the small traces of nitrogen are four times the amount found on Earth, although nitrogen makes up more than three-fourths of the terrestrial atmosphere. This composition causes a runaway greenhouse effect that heats the planet even hotter than the surface of Mercury, although Venus lies farther from the sun." here: [https://www.space.com/18527-venus-atmosphere.html]. This makes it sound like CO2 could really be a problem for us! But more surfing finds this: "The atmosphere of Mars is about 100 times thinner than Earth's, and it is 95 percent carbon dioxide." and "The average temperature is about minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 60 degrees Celsius), although it can vary from minus 195 F (minus 125 C) near the poles during the winter to as much as a comfortable 70 F (20 C) at midday near the equator.", here: [https://www.space.com/16903-mars-atmosphere-climate-weather.html]. With a little more surfing, we find : "Over the course of a full lunar day and night, the temperature on the Moon can vary wildly, from around +200 to -200 degrees Celsius (+392 to -328 degrees Fahrenheit), so it‚Äôs natural to wonder how lunar astronauts survived this huge temperature variation." and "The astronauts‚Äô spacesuits were designed to reflect almost 90% of the light that reaches it, so very little heat would have transferred to the astronauts.", here: [https://www.spaceanswers.com/space-exploration/how-did-lunar-astronauts-survive-the-extreme-temperatures-on-the-moon/]. So, with 4 items in relatively close proximity as space goes, we have a globe with a lot of CO2 atmosphere, a globe with a quantity of mixed gas atmosphere, a globe with a thinner CO2 atmosphere, and a globe with no atmosphere. And, with an extremely dense CO2 atmosphere and closer proximity to the sun, you get a hot globe. But, with a high percentage of CO2, though less density and more distance from the sun, you could freeze to death, or at midday near the equator be comfortable. While, on the globe with no atmosphere, you alternately bake or freeze! It seems our atmosphere is reflecting a lot of the energy the moon receives and the same mechanism tends to reflect the energy that gets through to earth, back to earth. Water vapour seems to be the key to that. GHG's absorbing and vibrating are a wonderful distraction but it really seems we haven't quite exited the last ice age and the planet is still warming to the long term (hundreds of millions of years) trend.

"the strength of co2 absorption already includes collisions with other molecules". Indeed. Includes, but not restricted to. An isolated CO2 molecule is still an IR absorber. That is not the case with O2 or N2. You are concerning yourself with something that is insignificant with respect to global warming, and is also almost unchanging, since the amount of N2 and O2 in the atmosphere are not changing significantly relative to their total amounts.

Nitrogen and oxygen are diatomic molecules made from two identical atoms and therefore do not have the requisite bending and vibrational modes, nor the requisite dipole moment, within the molecule to enable them to absorb in the infrared. They are transparent to infrared. A molecule needs to have at least three atoms within it, or two dissimilar atoms, in order for the possibility of infrared absorption to exist.

Those "experts" know that, make a smooth curve of the samples and fix it to the modern curve. Saying "has always been only around 280 ppm" is just pseudo science, sorry. They have no exact measurements, only samples by proxy. The actual 408 ppm CO2 is no problem. The ocean is still not acidic (above 8 ph) and will not be in future. If you find a REAL OCCURING problem due to 408 ppm CO2 please LET ME KNOW (PROOVE).There is a logarithmic relation between CO2 concentration and IR absorption/emission, so increase from 300 ppm to 400 ppm should have more effect than increase from 400 ppm to 500 ppm in the future.

The ice core evidence correlates between different ice cores. The only reason you believe the various references you give above, some of which you clearly do not understand and others of which are from very dubious sources, eg Jaworowski, Humlum and even Salby (!!) , is because you believe they support what you want to believe. I've explained this to you previously, as I've also explained Knudsen diffusion, but I'm not going to waste any more time on someone wedded to wilful ignorance.

Here you are again spreading your tripe 'science' and dogmatic propaganda from the Scripps/'realclimate' misinformation sites. Some can be forgiven on the basis of ignorance about their assertions and claims, but you cannot be. After all the times I have corrected you on this, apparently, not a single thing has penetrated, so here I present a refresher for you; The claim about CO2 levels being man-made and higher than for ‚Äòthousands/millions of years‚Äô are only true if you blindly believe the ice core record for CO2, I don't; I check it. See non-ice core & plant stomata proxies for a different CO2 record; non-ice core proxies show that CO2 often goes over 400ppm, and the current level is certainly nothing unusual. ‚ÄúRapid atmospheric CO2 changes associated with the 8,200-years-B.P. cooling event‚Äù; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/243/full.pdf?sequence=1 (see p57 & p75 for CO2 at or above 400ppm) Also; https://debunkhouse.wordpress.com/2010/03/28/co2-ice-cores-vs-plant-stomata/ Plant stomata proxies, such as the one by Kouwenburg; (2004) show that CO2 was well above 400ppm in 500 AD; http://meteo.lcd.lu/globalwarming/Kouwenberg/co2_reconstruction_stomata.jpg The graph is from his PhD thesis which is here; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/243/full.pdf?sequence=1 This rise to above 400ppm matched a huge rise in global temperatures which is clear in the GISP2 record of isotope O18. This is strong support for the CO2 rise being real. There are other examples in the paeleo records like this one. http://bp.snu.ac.kr/lecture/presentation/%ED%97%88%EB%AF%BC%EC%9E%AC.pdf http://www.pnas.org/content/99/19/12011.long?origin=publication_detail http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?hl=en&q=Atmospheric+CO2+%EF%AC%82uctuations+during+the+last+millennium+reconstructed+by+stomatal+frequency+analysis+of+Tsuga&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5 Prof Murry Salby‚Äôs work shows that CO2 varies much more than the ice core record shows; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_hBOU26F5o Salby‚Äôs work has been validated by Swedish climate scientist Pehr Bjornbom; http://www.klimatupplysningen.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Rekonstruktion-av-Murry-Salbys-teori.pdf This is also supported by Humlum et al‚Äôs work; "The phase relation between atmospheric carbon dioxide and global temperature"; O Humlum, K Stordahl, JE Solheim - Global and Planetary Change, 2012 http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?hl=en&q=The+phase+relation+between+atmospheric+carbon+dioxide+and+global+temperature&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp Humlum‚Äôs work shows that atmospheric CO2 changes are caused by changes in global temperatures, not human emissions. There is a 10-month lag between warming and any CO2 change, the change originates in the southern oceans, not in anthropogenic CO2 emission changes. There are many papers using stomata proxies in the literature which show CO2 varied dramatically over the last 2,000 years, thus directly disputing the monotonic ice core record. (Prof Salby explains why the ice core record is monotonic for CO2) These peer-reviewed papers were totally ignored by the IPCC in all its reports because they did not agree with the political story-line in the summary reports. Steinthorsdottir (2013) shows CO2 at 400ppm during the Younger Dryas. See; dwarf birch stomata Steinthorsdottir (2013) http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1,5&q=dwarf+birch+stomata+steinthorsdottir Knudsen diffusion effect and the Siple ice core and the hockey Stick frauds; The problems with the ice cores are related to the Knudsen diffusion effect; a pressure of 320bar within the ice core overall, minimizes variations and reduces maximums for CO2 measurements. The CO2 record in most reconstructions has been spliced together from two different records; the ice-core proxy CO2 data and the Mona Loa atmospheric measurements of CO2. The records have plainly been forced to fit together from 1958 where they did not, in reality, match up. The Siple ice core data when un-adjusted showed 330ppm in 1891. Jaworowski has showed that the data was then shifted, without any good reason, 83 years forward to match up with Moana Loa data; http://www.goldenageproject.org.uk/downloads/scientific_paper_on_global_warming.pdf The most famous ice core, the Vostok (Antarctica) core, with air inclusions allegedly representing the global paleoatmospheres over the last 160,000 years, show CO2 levels below 200 ppmv for many tens of thousands of years spanning 30,000 to 110,000 years BP (Barnola et al., 1987). "Most geochemists were convinced that changes such as these could not occur", says Sarmiento (1991) about these low alleged paleoatmospheric CO2 levels. Such low atmospheric CO2 levels below approximately 250 ppmv (McKay et al., 1991) would have led to extinction of certain plant species. This has not been recorded by paleobotanists, showing clearly that the ice core CO2 results are not representative of paleoatmospheres (Jaworowski et al., 1992 b), hence the CO2 -ice-core-method and its results must be rejected.

Since that time humans have added MORE THAN ENOUGH CO2 to the atmosphere to cause the concentration to rise to 408ppmv. That is HIGHER than it has been for several million years, and the cause is entirely due to human activity. That is the reality of the situation.

We know that because there are records (or good estimates) of i) how much CO2 has been emitted to the atmosphere by humans burning fossil fuels since the eighteenth century, and we also know ii) how much CO2 has accumulated in the atmosphere in that time. And i) is much greater than ii) (the balance has mainly been absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial biosphere and soils). Since humans have emitted far more to the atmosphere than has accumulated in the atmosphere, it follows that the increase is entirely human caused.

It's already there. The only thing that is stopping it is the polar ice caps. They act as the air conditioners of the world. Once one of them is gone, temperatures will quickly rise. 2) The permafrost is thawing right now. It has been thawing for several years now. There is enough greenhouse gases to triple that which we have in the atmosphere. Just a 10% thaw is enough to wipe out all life on this planet. The Arctic council released a 2017 report stating that 20% will thaw before 2040. 3) Below the seabed along every continental coastline, there lies vast amounts of methane hydrates. Methane in the atmosphere is 155 times worse than CO2 as a greenhouse gas when it is released. Since we only care about what methane is doing now that is the only value that is important. Since the oceans are warming up, the heat will destabilize these methane hydrates and it will be released into the atmosphere. There is enough methane to increase global temperatures a hundred fold easily. 4) As a US research paper concluded in 2015, ocean warming is unstoppable. 5) The burning of fossil fuels creates the greenhouse gas CO2 but it also produces a lot of airborne pollution. The pollution is responsible more many deaths worldwide (as much as 6 million) but it also has a positive effect. It is blocking some of the sunlight that reaches us. This effect is called Global Dimming. It was discovered after 9/11 where the daily temperature range increased by 1.1¬∞C in just 3 days. That is the result of all of the aircraft being grounded. If we convert to greener energy choices, the pollution will fall from the skies and the air will be cleaner but temperatures will rise very quickly too as the Global Dimming disappears. The pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels is actually buying us time. We are living on borrowed time. 6) Time. We don't have much. Almost everyone is treating Global Warming as a linear growth. They portray it as a gradual increase in temperatures. This is a falsehood. Global Warming is speeding up exponentially. This means we don't have until 2100 to figure things out. That is what the fossil fuel industry wants you to think. We don't have until 2040 either. The IPCC report stated that we only have until 2030 but the IPCC report uses 10 year old data. A lot has happened in the past 10 years which changes that timeline. The permafrost thawing started in the past 10 years. The IPCC report does not include many of the recent findings. It makes the erroneous statement that the Arctic will only become ice free once every 100 years. That is simply not true. Once the Arctic loses it's ice in the Summer, every following summer will be ice free and the ice free season will grow with every additional year. The simple truth is that we have ran out of time. Every climate plan takes time to enact. Legislature from not just one country but all countries would need to be changed to allow the necessary infrastructure to be built. Resources would have to be gathered on such a massive scale to build what we need that even the entire population of the Earth could not do it in time. Once the structures are in place the result will take time to have a positive effect. In short there is not enough runway for any climate plan to take off. There isn't enough time. 7) Some of the processes I have already pointed out are called feedback loops. These are cycles that produce whatever fuel they need to continue on. For example the permafrost releases greenhouse gases as it thaws. That greenhouse gas warms the area even more and thus causes more thawing. This is a continuous cycle that doesn't stop until there is nothing left to fuel the thawing. Once a feedback loop begins it is virtually impossible to stop. Worse yet is that these feedback loops not only power themselves but they help to power other feedback loops. There are now over 70 individual feedback loops in place. There will be more as the world continues to warm up. A tipping point is reached once any feedback loop begins. So when scientists tell you that tipping points have not been reached yet, they are lying to you. There have been over 70 tipping points that have already been passed. Now all of this does not mean you should give up the fight. You can still fight in vain if it helps you fill your need of being useful. But you can also just make sure that everyone is prepared for what is coming at them in a very short time. It's not going to be pretty. The WWF released a report that stated that 60% of all wildlife has died in the past 40 years. It did not say how much died before 1970. We have cut down a lot of forests to make room for cities and crops. The animals in those forests didn't just move away. They died. This means we are well past the halfway point of our own extinction. We just don't see it because there hasn't been any major human death toll yet. That is coming very very soon. It will happen during the Summer months when heatwaves become so intense that people just cannot survive outdoors. It's almost there now. Scientists have also projected that the next 5 years are going to be exceptionally hotter than it already has. If you can't survive the Summer heat then the rest of the year doesn't matter. You'll be dead. There are ways to lessen the death toll though. During the Summer months the working hours can shift to night so that people are going to work at night when it's cooler and sleeping during the hot day with their AC units on. Hopefully the grid does not fail due to major storms. Underground cables can help there. Personalized energy production would be ideal but as I stated before, converting to greener energy will end Global Dimming and then we feel the full effect of Global Warming. I would instead compartmentalize the power sources more so that when the grid falls it does fall for the entire region. There could also be switching where the downed region could take from the surrounding working regions and thus not lose power after all. Piggybacking if you will. Making it so that everyone gets free medicare is a good move. Every nation has the ability to do this. They can make it easier for those still alive to live whatever time they have left. There is no point in hording all that money when it becomes useless at our extinction. Using all that money to ease the suffering of the masses is the only humane thing the super rich can do now. I would like to add an extra point for those that are still not convinced that we have very little time. Has nobody ever wondered why there is such a mad rush to send people into space? The US wants to send people to the moon this year. Why the rush? It's because the governments know how much time is left. They have to make some attempt to continue the human race and getting people off the planet is the only way to do it. On that note, have a good day and good luck in whatever you choose to do.üòè	UCmPem0jf3XWBrEf9VeUxybQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmPem0jf3XWBrEf9VeUxybQ	1	UgwrLvyCpf6LikNyFHR4AaABAg	debess

Think the temperature of the planet is rising, and will cause freshwater shortage? Get a grip! Ocean water evaporation is what produces freshwater. Get out your grade school science book, and look it up. As air temperatures rise, oceans evaporate faster; producing increased freshwater precipitation over the land masses.

You are correct however that I mistated that it was the first law. It is in fact the third law. The air in the balloon is under pressure. That pressure exerts an equal force on all parts of the interior of the balloon's surface. Creating an opening in the balloon at one point removes the force on the interior surface at that point. The force at the opposite point of the ballon remains. That unbalanced force drives the balloon forward. http://www.homeworkassignmenthelp.com/images/action-reaction-force.jpeg As the air exits the ballon, it deflates until there is no more pressure force inside the balloon to drive it. Precisely that same principle drives rockets where the ejected gases are from burning fuel.

I don't see your point. "Where are the papers deatiling the gravity of objects in space? where is the experimentation?" Start with Newton's magnum opus, "the Principia". The experimental validation is everything done for about 200 years after except the problems with the orbit of Mercury which was solved by Relativity. The ballon thing is not about the magical creation of a force inside the balloon. You are correct that it is a demonstration of Newton's first law of motion. Every action has an equal and opposie reaction. Expulsion of air out of the balloon opening causes motion of the balloon in the opposite direction. When the air ceases to be expelled due to deflation of the ballon, there is no more driving force on the balloon.. The same principle, the expulsion of gases from the burning of rocket fuel, drives the rocket. When the fual is gon, the rocket coasts at a constant velocity (Newton's second law.) Look , I have a PhD in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and a graduate diploma in the history and philosphy of science. Unless you can come up with an argument that is better than a ludicrous ad hom attack on NASA sceintists. I think this discussion is at an end.

Relativity is second only to quantum theory in terms of the precision of experimental verification. But relativity and quantum theory are at present incompatible at the sub atomic level. Relativity is a pre quantum, or classical theory. Einstein never liked quantum theory. He said "God does not play dice." To which Niels Bohr replied, "Stop telling God what to do." That is why people are searching for a grand unified theory (GUT) or a theory of everything (TOE).

I may have misunderstood what you said, but if so it is because you have not clearly expressed yourself. I am not "blatantly misconstruing it.' Your second post also lack clarity. I am not sure what you mean by this: " in space they have negated earths gravity since weightlessness/ free fall exists, so one should expect to see gravitational effects . between the fueland the rocket ." Nor this: "Well i say it (weightlessness exists , its merely claimed to exist, 99.9 percent or more haven't observed many claims about space they merely have maths.' Physicists don't use the term weight" They refer to mass. I used 'weghtless' as that is the sloppy term commonly used by non physicists. Water 'sticks' to a football by electrostatic forces, and yes, gravity tries to pull the water off. Before Einstein, Newton described gravity a a force, associated with every mass in the universe, and extending to infinity, falling off according to the inverse square law. Practically, small masses, or distant large masses can be ignored. General relativty says that masses curve space around them. The bigger the mass, and the closer to the mass, the greater the curvature. Relativity was confirmed by the survature of starlight observed during an eclipse. For most practical applications, Newton's view is a peectly usble approximation. Nasa uses it tomsend probes to the edge of the solar system. Bur GPS systems would not work if relativity was not taken intoaccount. I can assure you that science does understand the tides on that basis, both with regard tothe effects of the sun and the moon. The sun is far more masssive, but the moon much closer, and so has the greater effect.

It falls off (according to Newton) as the inverse square of the distance from the mass responsible. It never dissappears entirely, no matter how far you are from the mass, be it the sun, the earth, Jupiter, Sirius, or the tea cup in front of me. Astronauts are not "weightless" in space. They are in free fal,l as are satellites orbiting the earth, According to Einstein, gravity is not a force, but the curvature of space caused by masses.

The scandal of how Mann created his hockey stick is one example. So is East Anglian climategate. Then there&#39;s the bogus 97% consensus that turned out to be an extreme abuse of statistics that bears no relationship to reality. There&#39;s the innumerable places where the IPCC reports were edited to contradict the very climate scientists that supposedly contributed to them. There&#39;s the falsification through extensive unwarranted secret &quot;proprietary adjustments&quot; of the historical records by NASA, NOAA and other governmental agencies. There&#39;s the complete dominance of the IPCC by advocates, politicians and interns rather than climate scientists. It&#39;s all a huge scandal that stinks worse with every passing year. <br /><br />There&#39;s the ridiculously hysterical alarmism that claims that we&#39;re all going to drown because the ice caps will melt and the oceans will flood all the cities. And those of us who don&#39;t drown will either starve to death or fry in catastrophic warming that will turn our planet into another Venus. Equally, the polar bears and the coral reefs will die, and the oceans will become acid baths. And just in case none of those things are enough, hurricanes and blizzards and all vaguely specified &quot;extreme weather events&quot; are also paradoxically blamed on global warming. It&#39;s all ludicrous silliness worthy of Monty Python. <b>There&#39;s absolutely no danger of any of it happening.</b> All have been debunked. And the absurd inclusion of perfectly ordinary winter weather and hurricanes as some of the effects of global warming makes the thesis unfalsifiable and therefore <b>unscientific</b> by definition.<br /><br />There&#39;s also the ridiculousness of the chief claim itself. CO2 is 400 ppmv, or .04% of the atmosphere. The anthropogenic contribution to that is 3%, or .0012% of the atmosphere. But most of the greenhouse effect isn&#39;t CO2 in the first place, it&#39;s mostly due to water vapor and clouds (between 70% and 95%). Most of the variation in atmospheric CO2 is entirely natural. In particular, the oceans release many times (16x or more) the CO2 of humans. In addition there are volcanoes, life forms other than ourselves that also emit CO2 when they breathe and forest fires started by lightning. There are also the other possible natural contributors to global warming to be considered: variations in albedo, sunspot cycles, etc. It should also be noted that average global temperature is only logarithmically sensitive to trace greenhouse gases such as CO2. In other words, <b>if it could be proven that temperature rose 1 degree Celsius exclusively because of a CO2 doubling from 200 ppmv to 400 ppmv, then it would take another doubling from 400 ppmv to 800 ppmv to produce the next 1 degree Celsius rise.</b> None of these facts are in dispute! <br /><br />So we see then, that anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 is a barely detectable increase in a trace gas contributing an insignificant and weakening minority of the greenhouse effect, which isn&#39;t even the only warming effect on climate. Furthermore, the global climate system is prepared to gracefully handle many times that increase from natural sources. <b>There&#39;s actually no physical way possible that the anthropogenic portion of atmospheric CO2 could possibly have more than an extremely trivial effect on global climate.</b> Only a homeopath (erroneously believes &quot;dilution increases potency&quot;) could possibly believe otherwise. It&#39;s totally laughable and anybody with an ounce of independent thinking ability ought to immediately recognize just how ludicrous the entire thesis is. <br /><br />Then there&#39;s the fact that the climate models have been proven to be erroneous and without any predictive value whatsoever. They have predicted a &quot;hot spot&quot; in the atmosphere that has never been measured, and they have predicted far more warming than has been measured. There&#39;s also the fact that the measurements have, without exception, been well within the range known to the historical record, notwithstanding false claims that they are &quot;unprecedented&quot;. <br /><br />The only country that really has a large number of weather stations is the USA. Thermometers in the rest of the world, especially the Southern hemisphere are extremely sparse. In terms of a global temperature mean, we don&#39;t actually have enough data to give a reliable number to the resolution of a single degree Celsius. The climate experts are relying largely on interpolation, using rather dubious methods that assume, for instance, that weather is consistent over several hundred miles in each direction from a weather station, which may or may not keep daily records. And yet we&#39;re trying to measure temperature increases that amount to perhaps a tenth of a degree per decade!<br /><br />It also needs to be pointed out that CO2 in the atmosphere is entirely natural and not a pollutant at all. <b>It&#39;s actually beneficial to plant growth,</b> and so would be the modest amount of warming that might result from an increase of CO2 in our atmosphere. Real greenhouses deliberately add CO2 to the air the plants breathe so that they grow better! <b>Far from starving to death due to CO2 &quot;pollution&quot;, we would see an increase in food production with increased CO2 levels.</b><br /><br />Last but by no means least, there are the temperature and CO2 surrogate records going back 2-3 billion years proving that this planet has enjoyed a relatively stable, life-supporting climate for that entire time, varying in average global temperature in a very narrow range (approx 275-300 Kelvin, or about 8.3%), even when CO2 levels were as high as 7000 ppmv. That is very strong empirical evidence that <b>the runaway catastrophic feedback mechanism assumed by all the IPCC models simply does not exist.</b> The global climate obviously has built-in thermostatic controls that climate science has not yet discovered.<br /><br />It&#39;s easy to see some of the mechanisms that might contribute to thermostatic control of the global temperature. Adding global heat by whatever means will produce additional evaporation of ocean water, which will evaporatively cool both the ocean and the air above the ocean. The resulting increase in clouds will increase the earth&#39;s albedo which will also have a cooling effect. The additional water in the air will eventually precipitate out and irrigate the plants growing on the land, increasing their abundance. Increasing plant life will also have a cooling effect on the immediate environment through additional evaporation. So we can see how the climate system immediately responds to increases in temperature with cooling effects, maintaining a relatively stable average global temperature.

Radiation of many wavelengths reaches the earth's surface and is converted into kinetic energy of atoms and molecules which is radiated from the surface as infrared energy. The more CO2 in the atmosphere, the more of this outgoing IR energy is intercepted and absorbed by the CO2 molecules. It is converted into increased kinetic energy of the molecule. Some of this intercepted energy is re-radiated back to the surface as IR, further heating it. Some of the extra kinetic energy is passed on to other gas molecules by collision before emission of a photon of IR radiation, warming the atmosphere	UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	1	UgzO-85sgy28y6sYmUZ4AaABAg	dlwatib

Less heat escaping into space does not increase the temperature of the earth's surface, just as insulation in a house does not increase the temperature of the heat source. Temperatures can only increase by adding thermal energy or by doing work on the system. The CO2 argument is based on trapped radiation and back radiation to the surface. It is basic physics as you say, but not as you describe. Radiation is electromagnetic energy not thermal energy. When the radiation from the earth is absorbed by the atmosphere it increases the temperature because the radiation moves from hot to cold. Therefore the electromagnetic radiation is thermalized. When the atmosphere emits radiation to the surface it is cold to hot and the second law of thermodynamics applies and so there is no heating. The radiation is just re-emitted to the atmosphere. The flaw in the infamous K&T energy balance diagrams is that they treat radiation as thermal energy and they also vastly over estimate the proportion of energy lost from the surface by radiation. A white hot steel bar does not even radiate this proportion of energy.	UC86naM13au5Lmx6rNOQ3smQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC86naM13au5Lmx6rNOQ3smQ	1	UgzO-85sgy28y6sYmUZ4AaABAg	dlwatib

The published graph did not in any way misrepresent the temperature record for the period shown. You have supplied no evidence to support you claims.

It was launched with a tricked up "paper" made to look like a genuine paper from the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. This drew a strong protest from PNAS. The petition has been collecting signatures since 1998. Signatories are only required to have (or claim) a BSc degree or higher qualification. Possession of such degrees does not qualify someone for the description ‚Äúscientist‚Äù unless they are engaged in research. The website does not explain how it verifies the claimed qualifications or identities of the signatories. Joke names such as Dr Geri Halliwell (aka Ginger Spice) have appeared on the list. The largest field of signatories, over 10,000, are engineers and over 2000 are medical practitioners. Generally, these people are not scientists. The 31,000 signatories, if genuine, represent about 0.3 percent of those eligible to sign. There is no provision for those who may have signed since 1998, but have changed their stance in the ensuing 20 years of accumulating evidence to have their names removed.

The recent expedition to the Antarctic now has advanced equipment to extract deeper ice core samples and to include the testing of the volume of Hydroxyl in excess of 600,000 years and search the isotopes in the ice core samples for a greater understanding of its effects upon Co2 in the atmosphere. A very interesting study of Organic Chemistry which is one of many components being researched by CREDIBLE scientists who deal in raw data and not speculation or supposition as do many of the so-called climate scientists who are using adjusted, altered and manipulated data. The alarmists are losing credibility rapidly as evidence is proving their false and misleading statements to be motivated by GRANTS, FUNDING, their TENURE, CREDIBILITY.

Molecules are not involved in Hawking radiation. There are no molecules on the surface of a black hole. A black hole is an extreme curvature of spacetime, not an object made of molecules. A black hole does not have a surface. It has an event horizon which if you passed through it, you would not be aware you had. But tidal forces would have mashed you by then. Hawking never received a Nobel prize. Greenhouse gas molecules come in a variety of geometries. CO2 is linear. H20 is V shaped at 109 degrees. The molecule absorbs IR radiation coming from the surface and heading into space and re-emits it in any direction, including back toward the surface. That is how increasing concentration of greenhouse gases causes warming. More molecules prevent IR leaving the atmosphere and redirect it toward the earth.

The point is that our agicultural regions, population centres cities and infrastructure are where they are because of the relatively stable global temperature and sea levels that have existed for the last 10,00 years. The temperature has only risen 1 C in that last century. Scientists say the real problems will occur when it reaches 2 C above that temperature. "nor can you with any degree of certainty demonstrate that a rise in temperature will continue unabated because of CO2. " Well I can actually. The logarithmic dependence of temperature on CO2 concentration is well known. https://knowledgedrift.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/log1-co2.jpg I have used this dependence it to calculate the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (the temperature rise with doubling of CO2 concentration) from global temperature and CO2 data to be 3 C. This is in the middle of the IPCC range.	UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	1	UgzO-85sgy28y6sYmUZ4AaABAg	dlwatib

Even if what you say is absolutely contradictory to the above clip, you still can't demonstrate in any appreciable way just HOW an increase in temperature of a few degrees at best is inherently detrimental, nor can you with any degree of certainty demonstrate that a rise in temperature will continue unabated because of CO2.

Most of my posts are editied to correct typos and sloppy edits, and sometimes to add further information and evidence. You must have been very quick off the mark as the editing was completed within five minutes of the original submission. Yes Ms Phin, Fourier did not call it the greenhouse effect. In answer to your question I merely stated that the basis for the theory goes back to him. And yes the greenhouse is an imperfect analogy as it warms by being a closed space that prevents hot air from escaping by convection, not by the heat trapping properties of certain gases.. So what? The big bang wasn't a bang, there is nothing divine about the God particle. Black holes are not holes etc etc. Its the actual theory that counts. A rose, grown in a greenhouse ot not, by any other name... And I did not nominate Tyndall's experiment as the be all and end all of climate science. It was an important step in the developement of the theory, specifically demonstrating the IR absorbing properties of some gases.. There has been another 159 years of further research since then.

It would be weird for Fourier to have invented "greenhouse gas" theory since he never used the word greenhouse or specify any types of gases. "First, it is important to recognize what Fourier did not do in his 1827 essay. He did not say that the operation of the atmosphere is analogous to that of a greenhouse ‚Äî the French word serre (greenhouse) does not appear anywhere in the essay ‚Äî so he should not be blamed for the well known shortcomings of the analogy. Neither did he write down any equations describing the greenhouse effect, nor compute any estimate of planetary temperature." -Pierrehumbert, Nature, Vol 432, Page 677 As for Tyndall, he proved that co2 can be warmed by radiation. What he did not prove is that this warming of co2 by radiation warms anything else, especially back down toward the surface of a planet.

There's references to other things, but not "co2 leading temperature". Fourier did not mention co2 at all, which is what you claimed. So you lied. You only proved my point, but then gave Keynes credit for something he never advocated: cutting taxes. I was talking about gov debt vs. business debt. If the gov cuts taxes, then businesses keep more money and require less debt. The gov debt increases and business debt decreases: inverse. Exactly what I said, and Keynes didn't.

I cite Keynes as a reference for a causal link. Even Nixon said "We are all Keynsians now." I left my retirement savings in international, largely US shares when Trump was elected in spite of predictions of economic doom because I recognised his policies of a massive infrstructure package plus tax cuts woul provide a boost to the economy (at the cost of a budget deficit of US S1 trilion). I put several hundred thousand of my dollars where Keynes' mouth is and have done very, very nicely thank you. Even the Liberal party is committed to balanced budgets "over the cycle". Meaning that they understand that deficits are required in times of economic downturn. Fourier proposed greenhouse gas theory in 1824. Measurements of absorption of IR radiation by CO2 came later that century. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.386/pdf	UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	1	UgzO-85sgy28y6sYmUZ4AaABAg	dlwatib

His actual data wouldn't allow any conclusions either way: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/nature_shakun_proxies_plus_co2.jpg Of course you cite Keynes the crackpot with no actual evidence, just "theory". Nope, sorry, money lent to government is money not lent to business. What you meant to say is that SOME businesses benefit from extra government debt. It seems that in addition to climate you are an economics ignoraMous. You don't seem to understand the simple concept of scarcity.

It is well known that temperature rise can lead an increase in CO2 concentration and CO2 concentration can lead temperature rise and both mechanisms are part of the climate record. See this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ3PzYU1N7A&t=32s There is indeed a causal theory as to how government debt can be good for business. (It is known as Keynsian counter cyclical stimulus). The theory of how increasing CO2 concentration increases temperature is well established. It is almost 200 years old. The evidence I provided showing that temperature is rising with rising CO2 concentration even as solar irradiance falls, and the rise is at the rate predicted by AGW theory is further evidence that the theory is correct.

Never did co2 lead temperature. We have a perfectly good explanation why extra solar energy would increase temperature and subsequently co2. You just don't want that to be the case. There is also a positive correlation between government debt and business loans. Using your retarded line of thinking you would conclude that more gov't debt is good for business. However when we plot (gov't debt YoY%) vs. (business loans YoY%) we get a completely different picture - they are completely inversely related. As gov't accumulates debt, business loans are reduced. As logic would predict, but is difficult to spot in the raw data. You know you are BSing.

That is why the lines on your graph oscillate about the zero point over a small range while the raw CO2 data steadilly increase, with a modulaton caused by seasonal variation.

Once again, you are parroting someone who is playing games with calculus rather than looking at the raw data. Last time it was integrals, now it is derivatives. The second graph is of RATE OF CHANGE of CO2 and temperature data. Not the raw data. The sawtooth pattern in the raw CO2 data is due to the growing and dormant seasons of plants in the northern hemisphere where most of the land mass is. The land also warms and cools more than the ocean with seasonal change. As temperature rises in the northern spring and into the summer, plant growth takes CO2 out of the atmosphere. At the same time cooling of the southern oceans in the southern autumn and winter means that more CO2 is absorbed by the oceans. http://woodfortrees.org/plot/esrl-co2 So yes, these mechanisms mean that seasonally, CO2 concentration falls in response to rising temperature, and rises in response to falling temperature in the northern autumn and spring, making the RATE OF CHANGE of CO2 lag the RATE OF CHANGE of temperature. A faster growing season due to faster temperature rise means a faster take up of CO2. That has nothing to do with the response of global temperature over time to rising CO2 concentration. Kindly explain what is happening with the WFT graph, with respect to the effects of the Isolate and mean functions on the raw data. Mean Months Running mean over the given number of months. Keeps the number of samples the same, but smooths them by taking the average of that number of months around each sample. Isolate Months Does the same running mean as 'mean', but then subtracts this from the raw data to leave the 'noise'	UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	1	UgzO-85sgy28y6sYmUZ4AaABAg	dlwatib

I have added some more information for the benefit of people who gan grasp basic science and mathematics. I said nothing whatsoever about gluing temperature data from any where onto ice core data at any level below ground. You cannot "glue" temperature data onto CO2 concentration data. You can compare temperature data with CO2 data. For the grown ups. You can actually do a calculation of the ECS from temperature and CO2 data and see how it compares with the IPCC value of 1.5 to 4.5 C. The following calculation is confined to the instrumental data period, where the temperature rise from CO2 concentration began to dominatet above the noise of natural temperature variatio.: Gistemp and Muana Loa data from 1958 to June 2017 0.157 ¬±0.022 ¬∞C/decade giving a temperature increase for the entire 59.5 year period of 0.934¬± 0.131 (The error margin is 14%) The rise in CO2 concentration in that time is from 315 to 405 ppm. (The error here is small and will be neglected) The relationship is logarithmic, and is given by the following equation: 0.934 = k log(405/315) where k is the proportionality constant k = 0.920/0.251 = 3.72 The temperature rise for a doubling of CO2 concentration is therefore 3.72 x log2 = 2.56 ¬± 0.36 ¬∞C	UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	1	UgzO-85sgy28y6sYmUZ4AaABAg	dlwatib

"Your arguments: 1) 400,000 yrs of ice accumulation is proof of warming, because warming grows ice." No my argument is that past CO2 concentrations can be obtained from ice cores. Never said that "proves' anything about temperatures. I have said that CO2 concentration correlates with temperature rise over the last 150 years, which is explained by AGW theory. "2) "sunpot integral" must be equivalent to mathematical definition of integral, it couldn't possibly refer to a much longer named operation that was trimmed for convenience." You gave no indication of what you meant by sunspot integral, so I gave you the standard definition. You then put up a graph, wihich shows a variation from the mean of the sunspot integal, without explaining precisely what that means. According to the standard definition, the integral cannot not fall unless there was a negative number of sunspots. I don't mean a decreasing number, I mean less than zero sunspots being counted. That is a physical impossibility. If you wish to see what is happening with solar output, whether it is rising or falling, you look at the numbers of sunspots, not the integral	UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	1	UgzO-85sgy28y6sYmUZ4AaABAg	dlwatib

For snow and ice to accumulate for 400,000 years it needs to get colder. If we really had the hottest temperatures in 400,000 right now, there would be no ice to take a core of.

Here once again is the data obtained from layers of ice laid down and going back over 400,000 years. https://www.co2.earth/images/figures/sks/sks_co2_400kyr_850.jpg Not only has the ice not melted all the way down to that level, snow continues to fall and lay down new ice layers in the interior of the antarctic. Air temperatures have not risen substantially there. Ice is being lost at the periphery of the continent largely due to the action of warmer water. Solar irradience means the output of sola energy. Once again, for the slow learners. People have been using sunspot numbers as a proxy for theenergy output of the sun to explain changes in the earth's temperature for a long long time. Thus the link between the Maunder minimum and the Litle ic age. There has been a recognition that declining sunspot numbers are signalling a new 'solar minimum' and "skeptics' keep telling me that we are headed for a noew little ice age, not a warming planet. You can find any number of you tube items on this topic. For example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWC8kx_fGlk I have pointed out to Mr Adapt 2030 that sinspot numbers and solar energy output have been falling for 4 decades, but temperatures continue to rise due to increasing CO2 concentration.

Clearly I also have to explain mathematics to you. The integral is the cumulative sum of the area under the graph. Even as sloar energy is falling the decresing amount of radition continues to add to the total.

I have already described how pine tree proxy data does not match with other proxy data and instrumental data after the 1960s. Prior to that date it does. Removal of rhat data in whole or in part does not alter the overall proxy/instrumental temperature record. El nino/La nina events are alternate warming and cooling periods of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and have no net effect on temperature over multi decadal time scales. You can refuse to call Mann a climate scientist, but as he has a list of peer reviewed publications in that field , the facts are gainst you. Climate science is a complex field of study and people from all kinds of disciplines from atmosperic physics to paleontology publish releveant research papers. Applied computer technologists are a minor subset. Supercomputers have applications way, way beyond crunching numbers relevant to climate science. Universities and other research institutions have been buying the latest in computer hardware , which is often obsolete by the time they uncrate it, such is the pace of change, long before their use in climate science. I try to be polite but as a scientist who understands science funding, procedures, peer review etc and has a dislike for attacks on the integrity and professionalism of scientists, if you make blanket evidence free ad hom atttacks on scientists as a substitute for scientific argument I may become rude . Non climate scientists such as myself would personally benefit from climate science and climate scientists being discredited as we have to compete with them for limited research funds. If there is a climate gravy train, they are stealing our gravy.

You are discussing this with a scientists whose PhD is in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy but who also has a great deal of experience in infra red spectroscopy. I am aware of the principles of the absorption of IR radiation. "The next step of energy transfer is not proven" In the first place, science does not do proofs. If you want proofs talk to a mathematician. A CO2 molecule excited by absorption of a photon of IR radiation can return to a lower energy state by re-emitting a photon of energy. That photon can be emitted in any direction, including back to the earth's surface, warming it. You are entirely correct that the CO2 molecule can also return to a lower energy state by passing on the increased kinetic energy caused by the absorption of the photon to other molecules in the atmosphere through collision. The extra kinetic energy is measured as an increase in temperature. "and certainly cannot be radiation to the earth's surface as this is unlawful" The processes of energy transfer I have described are entirely consistent with physical laws. Theoretically, these processes are a no brainer, and the laboratory experiments demonstrating them have been repeated countless times. But never mind laboratory experiments. Human's have been conduction the experiment in the atmosphere for a couple of centuries. Even though sloar activity is falling, atmospheric temperature has been rising with CO2 concentration, and at a rate predicted by the theory. http://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/mean:12/plot/sidc-ssn/from:1880/normalise/plot/esrl-co2/normalise/scale:1/offset:0.35/plot/uah5/mean:12/offset:0.43	UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	1	UgzO-85sgy28y6sYmUZ4AaABAg	dlwatib

You seem to miss the exact point used to support your claim is not a valid premise.... Remember this one "if all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you?"

Virtually no geologists will support the AGW agenda as history tells us, not using tree rings or ice core, there has been warmer times with much higher CO2 levels. With regards to peer review. That isn't as authoritative as you may think. Hubble received a Nobel Prize for red shift that later turned out to be wrong. Same, same for the background radiation theory that was used to "prove" the big bang in some people minds. Science has become dogmatic and doctrinal. Not unlike a religion in that way.

IPCC uses the term Solar Irradiance which is just the Visible and infra-red spectrum. IPCC claims that all UV is absorbed in the upper atmosphere and is constant in all the models. Recently it has been shown that when sunspot activity is at its lowest, UV radiation is up to 10 times the level, and as beach goers know universally, that UV radiation is definitely making it's way to earth's surface. Most UV is absorbed by living organisms and re-radiated as visible light and/or heat. So as sunspot activity has dropped, UV has increased and may be a major contributor to the warming.

The next step of energy transfer is not proven, and certainly cannot be radiation to the earth's surface as this is unlawful. It is most likely that a collision with another atom or molecule would happen on the next few picoseconds and transfer the energy kinetically, or be collected by water vapour or droplets. Someone needs to reaffirm Arhenius' laboratory experiment to prove the Green House Effect where the light source is better isolated from the Chemical Chamber, and without the use of Carbonic Acid (as he used) and without any water present. It is hypothesized by some Physicists that most or all of the warming measured was the effect of radiated energy from the lamp being absorbed by the chamber materials, and not the gas.

By weighting this data the temperature proxy shot up, but by removing this specific proxy the temperature relationship flattened out considerably. That's not Scientific, and why I refuse to call Mann a Climate Scientist ...he's a poor Climato-Botanist.

The uncertainties in the 1999 paper which extended the proxy data back from 1400 AD in the 1998 paper to 1000 AD can accomidate the MWP. A still later paper by Mann et al shows the MWP more clearly.

Mann's "hockey stick" was validated by a 160 page national academy of science report to congress, The concerns of MacIntyre and McKitrick that the uptick was due to the use of Principal Component Analysis were found to be mistaken when the daat was analysed by methods not including PCA, which yeilded the same result. Although it was already superceded by similar results from other groups when the NAS report came out. The "climategate' emails do not say what skeptics' claim they said. Mike's 'Nature trick', adding instrumental data onto proxy data was described in the aper. A strange way to mislead people when you stte exactly what you are doing. The "hide the decline remark was not about mann's graph. It was a disussion about Briffa's proxy data from some species of trees that showed a divergence from other proxy data and instrumental measurements from the 1960's on. It is also discussed in the scientific literarure. The cause is not known but it is thought that annthopogrnic factors on tree ring growth are responsible.The UEA scientists were discussing the preparation of a cover illustration for a World meteorological report. The scientists discussed leaving Briffa's data out entirely, but they decided not to throw the baby out with the bath water and kept the data supported by the other proxy data and instrumental data. The decline being "hidden" was the incongruous tree ring proxy data, not any decline in the actual temperature as "skeptics" tried to assert. The cover illustration correctly showed what had been happening to global temperature. You are putting up a number of straw man arguments that are not what climate scientists say will happen. Show me a paper which says that all the cities will be flooded due to sea level rise. Show me where the earth is predicted to become another Venus. Show me where it is said that the oceans will become acid baths. Co2 concentration is indeed currently 400 ppm, up 45% from the preindustrial level of 280 ppm. The anthropogenic contribution is currently about 3% per year., some of this taken up by the oceans and some by plant growth. There is nothing ridiculous about the claim that the rise in CO2 concentration is causing temmeratures to rise. It is basic physics. You ar correct that the rise due to CO2 with doubling of the concentration is 1.1 C. Callendar calculated that in 1938. And it is rue that H2O is he major greenhouse gas. That is why the effective ECS is calculated to be higher than 1.1 C. Higher temperatures mean higher H2O Concentration in the atmosphere. Apsoitive feedback. There are also negative feedbacks. More clouds means more incoming sunlight is reflected back into space. Negative feedback. Although they also mean thsat less heat escapes back to space on cloudy nights. Positive feedback. Less arrctic ice due to a warming arctic ocean means more dark ocean and less light reflected back to space. Positive feedback. Etc, etc. The difficulty in quantifying the feedbacks is why the IPCC range for the ECS is given as between 1.5 and 4.5 C. Even Spencer and Christy affirm that the absence of the tropical 'hotspot' could be due to instrumental uncertainties. It should be there even ifthe warming is due to non anthropogenic forcings. uncertainties. Spencer says it may be due to contamination of tropospheric temperatures from falling stratospheric temperatures. Which cannot be explained by other forcings. The warming of the troposphere and the cooling of the stratosphere, as observed by satellites, is a signature of AGW. And satellite lower troposphere temperature rises agree with surface station data. Here is satellite and surface temperature data, Mauna Loa CO2 data, and sunspot data, a proxy fo solar irradience. Even though solar irradience has been falling for decades, temperatures have risen with CO2 concentration, and at an ECS rate of 2.6 C, within the IPCC range. http://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/mean:12/plot/sidc-ssn/from:1880/normalise/plot/esrl-co2/normalise/scale:1/offset:0.35/plot/uah5/mean:12/offset:0.43	UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQZrb8SXC-TthSUiCFBMQw	1	UgzO-85sgy28y6sYmUZ4AaABAg	dlwatib

The media reports this as "97% of all scientists say the Earth will be 30¬∞ warmer in the next 2 decades and it is all due to the human race and our love for fossil fuels!!"
