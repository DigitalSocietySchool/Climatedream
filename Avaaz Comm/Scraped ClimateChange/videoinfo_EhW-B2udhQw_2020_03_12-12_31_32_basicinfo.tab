title	25 NASA Scientists Question the Sanity of the Global Warmists
description	Here we see four former NASA scientists trash the global warming hysteria. Dr Hal Doiron Leighton Steward Tom Wysmuller Walter Cunningham Back in the days when NASA was a genuine scientific organisation, and did real science, such as moon trips, these four men worked there.They represent a group of 25 former NASA scientists / astronauts, who now run the climate realist website; http://www.therightclimatestuff.com/ and wrote this report for policy-makers in 2013; Doiron, H. H. (2014). BOUNDING GHG CLIMATE SENSITIVITY FOR USE IN REGULATORY DECISIONS. It can be found here; https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/executivesummaryboundingghgclimatesensitivityforuseinregulatorydecisions1402281.pdf Using data and logic, here they throw cold water on the hysterical CO2 fanatics who are crying and whining about the coming fictitious 'climate catastrophe'. The 25 former NASA scientists also sent the incoming President, Donald Trump, this report on climate science in November, 2016; http://nebula.wsimg.com/1ca304a328496c0c011ac02790fc56ed?AccessKeyId=4E2A86EA65583CBC15DE&disposition=0&alloworigin=1
