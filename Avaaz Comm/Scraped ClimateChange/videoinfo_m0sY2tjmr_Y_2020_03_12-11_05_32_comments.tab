I live in a city which is know for it&#39;s moderate temperature and that&#39;s why I moved here but in last 10 years the average temperature has risen by 5-6 degrees Celsius...and its becoming warmer day by day ..... I would say people to plant more trees and use solar energy...... these people are misleading coz they have money invested in oil .I am not saying you go buy electric car what I am saying is plant more trees and use solar energy .you should see the speed with which ice is melting in Antarctic .

UgxvzXTZgZzdxeh04pR4AaABAg	1	0	2020-02-02 19:50:42	SwiftlyTiltingPlanet	A REALITY CHECK FOR DAN PENA:<br />30 years ago, the scientists predicted that temperatures would continue to rise. Were they right? <br /><br />20 of the last 22 years were the warmest on record. So were the last ten. So was the summer of 2019. The oceans are the warmest ever recorded. Record warm temperatures are now outpacing record cold ones by a two to one margin. The heatwave involving 17 countries in 2018 was the largest heat event in recorded history. <br /> <br />Score one for the scientists. <br /> <br />They also said that warming would concentrate at the poles. Were they right? Average temperature in Alaska, northern Canada and the Arctic has risen 5-7 degrees in fifty years. Average winter temperature in Barrow, Alaska has risen an astonishing 9.8 degrees F since the mid 20th century.  <br /> <br />Score another for the scientists. <br /> <br />They also said the icecaps would melt. The Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica are all melting at rates unprecedented in recorded history. In fact, the melt rate is accelerating.  <br /> <br />Score another for the scientists. <br /> <br />Sea level will continue rising and accelerate. According to the latest bulletin from the World Meteorological Organization, average global sea level rise is now 5mm per year, up from 4mm six years ago and 3mm in the 1990s. It is indeed accelerating.  <br /> <br />Score again for the scientists. <br /> <br />High tide flooding will increase. According to NOAA, high tide flooding along the American southeast coast has risen 190% in just 20 years. The northeast is up 140%.  <br /> <br />Score: Scientists. <br /> <br />Extreme Precipitation events will increase. The first quarter of 2019 was the wettest in U.S. history. Extreme downpours, meanwhile, have risen 55% in the northeast since 1960. They&#39;ve risen 30-40% in the south, midwest and northern states. Similar increases in extreme precipitation are being seen around the world. <br /> <br />Score: Scientists.

The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can’t speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what’s going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly up or down, which’s effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others.

If they were so worried about man made CO2 then why do they not do something about termites which create ten times more CO2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2 and only about 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines?

( That’s not even a fart in the wind ). Thank you for reading this.	UCbHNpBcwr2TfLCS4Cki9fkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbHNpBcwr2TfLCS4Cki9fkQ	0

We are entering a grand solar minimum it&#39;s going to get colder and crops will fail creating vast food shortages around the world!! Goverments know full well that we are going to be very short of food this winter yet they say nothing to we the British people who will be harmed by these food shortages!! Why are they still allowing millions of immigrants from Third World countries into Britain today knowing full well that we are going to be short of food for real British people who pay their taxes for what?? To watch this government spend over 17billion pounds of our money to support these uncivilized uneducated immigrants in Britain today?? This is why the British people voted for brexit to close our borders to all immigrants who don&#39;t work but claim benefits from British taxpayers!! The British establishment is behind this mass immigration into Britain to create such hardships for the British people who will end up with very low wages unable to support their families while immigrants get houses and benefits from our taxes!! It&#39;s to lower standards and expectations for the British people who have worked hard for British industry and made them rich!! But now these rich globalists want to destroy all Christian countries with mass immigration!! Taking away from the British taxpayers the right to decent wages!! These establishments bastards want to enslave every British person!! They want workers who will be fighting for jobs they want to reduce our living standards to control all people! This is the globalists agendas now in Britain today!!	UC4EAEkniyb7WS2pRWr9y0tg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4EAEkniyb7WS2pRWr9y0tg	0

CO2 isn't bad for our Earth or our health. Other particles are, sure, but not CO2 - so reducing CO2 is a waste of money. And that's what the entire industry revolves around - CO2, a harmless part of the greater climate and health threats out there. So don't come here with this basic bitch 'oh well they're doing it for the environment so can we really complain' - FUCKING YES WE CAN.

And boom; price per barrel will go through the roof. <br /><br />I understand it&#39;s not quite a case of &quot;simply fudge the numbers&quot;, however, China is infamous for this. They do it with companies on the NYSE en masse. <br />None so big as ARAMCO but the Saudis could do it, apologize (or not, or tell us to f off) and then start over; except from a place probably 50% between the price before the false numbers and highest manipulated price post false numbers.<br /><br />Maybe I&#39;m not fully understanding this, if you see where/how I&#39;m misunderstanding, please set me straight.

Insecticides are therefore not the root cause of population collapse. <br /><br />Insects play a critical role in the life process of the planet. <br /><br />Time to rethink the ever increasing use of wireless technology.<br /><br />Ref - just one of hundreds of research reports ignored by the wireless industry:<br /><br />&quot;Effect of electromagnetic radiations on brooding, honey production and foraging behavior of European honeybees (Apis mellifera L.)<br />Pramod Mall* and Yogesh Kumar<br />Department of Entomology, College of Agriculture, G.

Put more firewood on and it gets hotter...if it all burns down then it gets colder. pretty simple --- If 100 years ago the population was an estimated 1.5 billion and now its 7.5 billion then it would make sense that 6 billion more people now need to stay warm at night when its cold so they burn (more wood) than 100 years ago. Since most electricity uses coal in America as well as the rest of the world and we keep increasing our demand for it every year and since most of the world doesnt have access to the electricity and power of europe and america that demand will increase and grow. Thus we will burn more coal to make electricity. Yes we will also use more wind and solar and water turbines, dams etc. But also we will burn more. SO WITH ALL THIS BURNING... I&#39;d LIKE to Know Who here thinks we&#39;re not warming things up? ________This guy looks like a lunatic and didnt answer any questions with scientific backing or provide any proof for anyone else to read.

Mitigating climate change and environmental degradation in general will require a significant change to the typical (a statistical average) human behaviour (including the emotively driven psychological response) of the average human (see evolutionary psychology topics regrading &quot;The stone age mind&quot;). Therefore it will (is proving) be difficult for humanity (on average) to make the necessary changes to any particular civilisation in time to prevent some of the most dire consequences of ecosystem failures (i.e. “They” (an average) won’t see it coming until it’s too late to prevent the “worst case” scenario of climate change and ecosystem dysfunction). <br />Thus, in order to try &amp; best circumnavigate severe ecosystem dysfunction (e.g. to the food web) ,human populations must understand, A.S.A.P ,themselves more accurately (on average) and what drives their behaviours. Also why these behaviours have evolved to be the way they are (e.g. Emotions that fit within the Esteem dynamics like Envy, Pride, Guilt, Hate, Love etc.). Ideally these current environmental destructive behaviours can be mitigated through a democratic &amp; cooperative route. Alternatively, over time (worst case scenario), humanities behaviours that positively correlate with causing environmental degradation will be reduced (by severe population reduction) by the ecosystem limiting factors they have caused (cause and effect). Natural laws that all species are ultimately governed by.	UCDNN0NPa_snO_x2Glw5RXyA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDNN0NPa_snO_x2Glw5RXyA	0

The strength of a wave is <br />determined by its wavelength which means the lesser wavelengths are stronger waves. <br /> <br />Only the UV rays having wavelength lesser than 240 nm (nanometer) have the capacity <br />to break the O2 molecule in earth&#39;s atmosphere into O and O, these molecules are now <br />called as Free Radicals. <br /><br />UV rays (&lt; 240 nm) + O3 ---&gt; O2 and &#39;O&#39; (Free Radical)<br /><br /><br />These free radicals roam around in the earth atmosphere then combines with other O2 molecules <br />and then form ozone O3 again. <br /> <br />O + O2 = O3 (ozone) <br /> <br />Now this ozone (O3) that is formed combines with UV rays from the sun having wavelength greater <br />than 240 nm (nanometer) and then again breaks down to O2 and O molecules <br /> <br />O3 + UV (&gt; 240 nm) = O2 and a free radical (&quot;O&quot;). <br /> <br />As long as the Sun is there, the process of Ozone formation is going to happen. <br /><i>______________________________________________________________________________________________________________</i><br />Half Life of a OZONE Molecule is only 30 min to max. 1 Hour which means Ozone will dissolve itself after its half life<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />CFC - U.S. Patent #3258500 - Dupont <br />----------------------------------- ------------------------<br /> <br />Dupont family was holding the patent #3258500 for Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and the patent was set to <br />expire in 1979. Until this time all the Air conditioner, Refrigerator companies were paying royalty for the <br />patent to dupont to use the CFCs on their products. <br /> <br />Dupont learnt that post the expiry of the patent, any body can use their CFC on various products without paying <br />royalty. So in order to prevent that from happening, the &quot;Duponts&quot; with their influence manipulated <br />the government and other regulatory organizations to declare CFC as a cause for their new propaganda <br />&quot;Hole in the Ozone Layer&quot;. <br /> <br />Was the &quot;Hole in Ozone layer&quot; really a hole ? <br />------------------------------------------------ ----------------------<br /> <br />The ozone hole is not technically a “hole” where no ozone is present, <br />but is actually a region of exceptionally depleted ozone in the stratosphere <br />over the Antarctic that happens at the beginning of Southern Hemisphere spring (August–October). <br /> <br />Why ozone layer is usually thin at north and south poles ? <br />---------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br /> <br />Due to Earth&#39;s spherical shape, the North and South poles normally receive less sun light compared to <br />other parts of the Earth. Since ozone formation is dictated by how much UV rays from the Sun <br />falls on O2, the North and South poles have always had a thin layer of ozone. <br /> <br />Duponts took advantage of this natural phenomena and created a propaganda stating that CFCs <br />were the primary reason for the depletion of Ozone AKA Hole in Ozone layer. <br /> <br />How does CFC affect Ozone ? <br />--------------------------- -------------------<br /> <br />UV rays from the Sun breaks the bond between the two chlorine atoms, releasing free chlorine <br />into the stratosphere, where it takes part in reactions that destroy ozone molecules while <br />regenerating the chlorine (known as a catalytic reaction). A catalytic reaction allows a single <br />chlorine atom to destroy thousands of ozone molecules. <br /> <br />UV rays -&gt; CFC --&gt; breaks into Free Chlorine molecule --&gt; Breaks the Ozone (O3) --&gt; O2 molecules + <br />Free Radical &#39;O &#39;<br /> <br />The Truth about CFC and Ozone regeneration <br />------------------------------------------- -----------------------------<br /> <br />The part of the story that fewer people know is that while the chlorine atoms freed from CFCs do <br />ultimately destroy ozone, the destruction doesn’t happen immediately. Most of the roaming chlorine <br />that gets separated from CFCs actually becomes part of two chemicals that—under normal atmospheric <br />conditions—are so stable that scientists consider them to be long-term reservoirs for chlorine. <br />Scientists have also proved with evidence that this chlorine gets out of the reservoir every Spring <br />due to increase in Temperatures from the Sun and weakening of polar Vortex. <br /> <br />This means that the ozone hole (AKA depletion of Ozone) grows throughout the early spring until temperatures warm and <br />the polar vortex weakens, ending the isolation of the air in the polar vortex. As air from the <br />surrounding latitudes mixes into the polar region, the ozone-destroying forms of chlorine disperse. <br />The ozone layer stabilizes again until the following spring. <br /> <br />New Patent for HFC replacing CFC by Dupont <br />------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br /> <br />Duponts with their propaganda about CFC causing hole in ozone layer had successfully manipulated <br />the entire world and while their patent for CFC expired, they immediately came up with a patent for <br />their new product called &quot;Hydrofluorocarbon&quot; (HFC) <br /> <br />HFC is comparatively more expensive to manufacture than CFC so more money into the Wallets of Duponts&#39;. <br /> <br />What is more intriguing here is that when all of us were using CFCs in our households in Americas, <br />Asia, Aus, Europe etc. No one ever raised a question on how the CFCs could cause a hole in the ozone layer <br />only in the polar regions where hardly humans lived. <br /> <br />The funniest part here is that majority of the commercial aircrafts fly between 31000 to 38000 ft <br />particularly in the Stratosphere where Ozone is present and No one ever banned these commercial jets <br />from flying on that zone. <br /> <br />The Elites and their Corporations are running the educational system, Science and technology, Big pharmas <br />and almost everything we come into contact with in our day to day lives.

It’s not about this one massive eruption that kills everyone. It’s not the movies. It’s suffering for people who live in poor countries with bad climate who can not shelter themselves from the catastrophes to come. And the animals too. It’s proven that becoming more green won’t just help the planet but you too. Carbon emissions aren’t good for your health as well. They effects our lungs, bring about new diseases and. Kill off species and exotic plants that are very useful in herbs, medicine. If global warming affects our planet, the planet will be fine after moving continents, resetting. It’s the people that are fucked. And if non-renewable sources are supposedly renewable and never ending, why not be sustainable? To build a world where animals, plants, and humans co-exist.

U can´t mine more than the half of fossil fuels (which were accumulated in the earth for million of years) in 3-4 human generations and spit it in the air without consequences. 2004 &quot;The Day After Tomorrow 2 were released, at this time it was kind of utopia, now it´s gettin real - (including east coast bomb cyclone). Climate will melt the ice at both poles, raise the sea level and shift fertile agricultural zones by hundreds of kilometers. Goodbye coastal towns.

There are more hydro, wave, geothermal etc. It doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s responsible for climate change we still have to deal with it. Rising sea levels catastrophic climate events etc. We should be turning deserts into rainforests not rainforests into deserts. It makes no sense to turn your back garden into a source of disease that&#39;s starts killing your family members lets stop doing it before the government blame us and use it as a way to curb our democratic freedom. Remember we are supposed to tell the government what to do that&#39;s what the vote is for yet they still seem to be telling us what to do. Go clean go green don&#39;t be a corporate government zombie you won&#39;t respect yourself in the morning. Oil is about money tax is about you paying for the pollution they caused wake up and smell the cancer it&#39;s reaching epidemic proportions and continuing to rise exponentially as toxic carcinogenic pollution increases every year on year. We&#39;re also fighting global wars to steal the oil to power the tanks to fight the wars to steal the oil. It is the love of money that is at the root of all evil on Earth. Ain&#39;t that the truth for just as we have sowed so have we reaped brothers and sisters.

As I mentioned before there are other alternatives that we can use to reduce fossil fuel dependence, even if we can’t cut use completely. Reguardless how the resources got there, currently they are holding copious amounts of carbon underground and out of the atmosphere. When you burn them, the carbon that took millions of years to store is now released instantly. That carbon will take another couple million years to be taken out of the atmosphere and back into the ground in the form of decaying plants and animals. The amount of carbon we are sending into the atmosphere can’t keep up with the rate it naturally is absorbed, therefore carbon levels will rise. Carbon dioxide is a green house gas, a gas that prevents reflected heat from the sun from escaping the atmosphere, trapping more heat. We know this. This is fact. This effect is why the earth is hospitable! If the atmosphere couldn’t trap heat we would be an ice ball! But on the flip side, if the atmosphere traps too much heat we will be an oven. Look at Venus right next door. it’s the hottest planet in the solar system but it’s not the closest. The extra heat is gained by the thick atmosphere composed of primarily CARBON DIOXIDE. In regards to lumber though, it is actually one of the most sustainable building materials, and we should actually be exploring more ways to build with it. Lumber can also be one of the least sustainable too however, because of the reason you stated and habitat degradation. It all comes down to how it is forested. Humans can’t control volcanoes, that’s just something we have to live with like hurricanes and earthquakes. I don’t think people should stop eating animals and animal products honestly, because it is such a vital element to cultural identity and it tastes really good haha, but the rate of consumption of animals and animal products is much too high. Too much red meat is know to cause heart problems and other health issues, and the same can be said with dairy. Plus the amount of food waste in America is ridiculous and wasteful. We are just wasting resources on over producing foods just for us to throw them away. We can also use the methane from cow waste to create energy, or at the very least dispose of it carefully, rather than sending it down rivers where it enters larger bodies of water and create algae blooms, like in the case of Lake Erie. I’m not suggesting we stop the use of these resources that we as humans have so ingeniously used to our advantage, we just need to be careful in our consumption, and use our resources more efficiently and produce them more sustainably. Also, it seems that your main point is that we humans should continue our practices because figured out how to, and that we can. Should people continue to use cocaine because humans figured out how to produce it? I think everyone would say no, because of the detriment to the individual, and to a society collectively as a result of high addiction rates. I just honestly don’t see how any individual could be opposed to reducing detriment of our surrounding environments unless you have stakes in the oil/ fossil fuel industry. Why does it matter that the power supplied to your outlets comes from wind, solar, and water rather than natural gas, coal, and oil? Shouldn’t it only matter that it is reliably supplied? Reducing consumption and unsustainable practices will not send us backwards, it can only bring us forward	UCNw85VOhELyZCFi0GYGWeZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNw85VOhELyZCFi0GYGWeZQ	1	Ugyda2CIO_la8fnZ9Ll4AaABAg	Zeke Lugo Santini

Bottom line is that God or Nature put this commodity in the ground for man to use for his needs. But now we must stop the use of this prescious commodity to save the earth! Another commodity that God or Nature gave man: Trees for lumber. Without lumber we could not make our humble or luxurious homes. Trees are needed to filter the air of carbon dioxide and release oxygen for us to breath, but we need the trees for lumber, too! Should we stop cutting down trees to save the earth? Another natural thing that God or Nature gave us: Volcano eruptions... will these eruptions have an impact on Climate Change? Should we stop those too? Do like Dairy products or steaks? I do! But AOC says that Cows contribute to Climate Change with their farts and we must stop the use of Cows to protect the Earth. Oops, their goes our delicious milk, creams, butter cheeses, steaks and our economy! When does it end? Life in the Old West was not easy. It was harsh with dirt roads, and dust everywhere, no running water for toilets, showers, kitchen sinks, no running water for our gardens, no comfortable vehicles to take you anywhere, no air conditioning available to keep you cool, no heaters to keep you warm, etc!

Of course that is the top of the line vehicle in its class, but this is a newly developing technology so it will become more accessible over time. Right now most electric cars can travel average 200 miles, which would get you too Indianapolis instead. When it comes to shipping the approach that should really be taken is just growing foods more locally or regionally, and you can save out on added transportation cost + wasted fuel. Otherwise The tech in those sectors are limited. But that’s why we should be saving the use of oil elsewhere. Use oil where we need, and where we can use cleaner energy. Oil fired power plants are around 45% efficient, and wind turbines match that efficiently, and hydro power doubled it at 90%. The best solar cells can capture 40% of the energy it receives, but most capture around 20. There is really no point on relying on dirty fossil fuels to power out grid when renewables are cleaner and just as efficient. Hopefully in the future engineers will find more sustainable ways for large scale long distance transport, but for know I’m eating local (well as much as I can, sometimes I want strawberries in December what can I say) P.S. Natural gas is actually 80% efficient so I’d rather that be used than oil	UCNw85VOhELyZCFi0GYGWeZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNw85VOhELyZCFi0GYGWeZQ	1	Ugyda2CIO_la8fnZ9Ll4AaABAg	Zeke Lugo Santini

If you vote for the other guys you&#39;re voting for racists and people that don&#39;t care about the world. Even though there is no proof of being rasist. Unless you unless you call saying make America great again is racist LOL. And there is also no proof that Republicans don&#39;t care about the environment. We all care about the environment even Republicans have children and do not want them to be harmed. The point is if Democrats continue to pay people to say Republicans are against saving the world and are all evil races then eventually the dumb people will get so used to it they will start to believe it.

Maybe we can&#39;t win.	UCkjVzpyqGCobe6Dw78b1ziw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkjVzpyqGCobe6Dw78b1ziw	0

If you want to live in a dystopia where people go around killing, stealing, raping others... you are insane. You people and your short sighted focus on money...it's astoundingly annoying. Additionally, you claim hate the idea of being a slave, but you have zero problems with being a slave to a god that demands fidelity and prayers... wtf? You are all over the place. You don't want liberty, you don't hate slavery, you just want to give up your liberty and worship some egotistical god in your religion because you think he's the baddest motherfucker in the universe...that's all. All that is required for you to worship and voluntarily be a slave to someone is if you think that person can give you all your desires or annihilate you instantly. You follow zero morals or ethics...otherwise, you would not tolerate such an insane idea... MIGHT does not make RIGHT. Remember this.

"As for control, rather live in a free market than socialism." <---- You live in a hybrid market, composed of socialism (military, education, infrastructure, police, fire etc...) as well as capitalism (free competitive markets). If you lived in a pure socialist state, you would be miserable. If you lived in a pure capitalist state, it would not live long due to unregulated greed that would pollute the world even faster than it does now and make even pray to God a privatized, monetized practice...even worse than the false monetized religions that you see every day on TV and driving to work...with all their slogans and logos selling you a product and not true salvation.

Infinite energy from natural hydro, solar, wind... or finite expensive in the long term fossil fuels that pollute? THINK. Fossil fuels pollute. This is a fact. Even if it does not contribute to climate change as you think...you would not hook up a car exhaust into your house and go to bed. That I can tell you. And you think your car emits co2 slower than your grass or trees? NOPE. Eventually, your shit is going to get fucked up. And you will be the first to cry 'why the fuck don't the gov. do anything about this? why didn't they make laws to stop this from happening?' This I can tell you. Just like seat belts, just like smoking cancer warnings, just like drinking and driving campaigns, just like every fucking public health service the gov. has created to help you and your progeny avoid those mistakes.

CO2 is needed to revert to oxygen. Electric cars is Bal*****, cause more damage to the planet through not recycling batteries more lead in our waters with other chemicals because of batteries like lithium, the governments say they will recycle them but why have they not recycle tonnes of mobile phone batteries which have been left in land filled sights across the UK since 1990 causing damage to the environment. How is this clean.Also electric vehicles cause cancer through EMF short waves like Gama rays X rays. More nuclear stations being built to cover things, this cannot be right for the environment.

That money will then go into the pockets of the far left ruling class and to push their Marxist agenda. Now climate change is real but it is called weather.

Why is it so bad that we can take care of the environment. Like even if the effects are slow, they still are there. And it affects most to people living in 3 world nations in poverty who don’t hav the means to shelter themselves when climate change effects them. Carbon emission affects health, that you can’t argue with. Because the pollution directly effects our lungs and other organs. And okay you and I might be safe from those harmful gases. Places like India, Delhi, the pollution is so thick that at night you can’t see the moon on most days. I’m not saying shit like 2012 is going to go down. But if the planet does come to an end, its the people that are fucked. Pardon my language but the planet will just move continents and reset itself while we cease to exist. Even if that happens years later, it’s what we do now that effect it. Why wait for the dead line to close and procrastinate. It’s a good thing to worry about our planet to keep it presentable. It’s the only one we have. Sorry for this long paragraph.

One of the functions of the RF is generating oxygen. IN the mid 80&#39;s our winters , once prolonged very cold periods , stopped. And they haven&#39;t come back since. Our weather patterns are no longer and hot dry periods are increasing. The Malvern springs actually dried up in 2011. IN BRITAIN!

We&#39;re headed into a very low level of solar activity (flares/sun spots) which means we&#39;re actually heading into another cooling period - probably to last about 400 - 500 years where winters are a little bit cooler than now and the number of cold days will be greater than we&#39;ve enjoyed for the past 500. C02 will be needed more than ever - I would invest in greenhouses and greenhouse gardening as well as some UV producing lights to prevent mold on your crops. The good news is that when the warming period returns, all that C02 that gets trapped during the cool periods, will be released into the atmosphere as the oceans outgas. Everyone needs to settle down and focus on efficient means to deal with potential mild consequences of <i>natural</i> changes in our regional climates.

First: radiating heat back to the earth is the worst way to transfer it. Condensation is the best way. That’s why clouds are the biggest influence to the weather. There is just not enough time during the day to transfer any significant amount of heat that way with a trace gas of 410 ppm. What makes it physically wrong, is that you lose energy all the time on its way back into space through entropy and adiabatic losses. It gets colder in the atmosphere the higher you go, because the pressure gets lower the higher you go, leaving more space for atoms to lose their energy. So if CO2 takes heat on, it will rise with the warm air up, where it is colder. It can release its energy only to something that is colder ie the atmosphere above it. Even if CO2 would effect this rise up theoretically, there is no influence to the global temperature, because the day has not enough hours for this bad sort of heattransfer. It’s like heating your drink over a fire while it’s in a coffe-mug that’s insulated. Once the hot air is up it’s physically impossible that it heats the hotter air underneath. It’s a scam. It’s about money and ruling the masses.	UCOb97doHgo7TdK-6HrsxjXg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOb97doHgo7TdK-6HrsxjXg	1	UgyE6N0n7dBlAQ4bDkN4AaABAg	Max Bliss

It isn't difficult to understand. CO2 absorbs the heat radiation from the planet. Instead of leaving the planet the energy is kept in the atmosphere. So some of it radiates back to the earth, some leaves the planet. And don't start with: It has not enough CO2. If we have enough CO2 to grow all the plants, we have enough CO2 to warm the planet.

One thing we can agree on is that a better understanding of science should help in deciding what is true regarding our climate. A university education in physics, chemistry, etc, in the vast majority of cases, leads to a particular understanding of the "truth"(not the best place to discuss this for now). To say Pena is not truthful regarding the science, like the majority of us, could be attributed more to ignorance rather than outright lying. If we are generous, we could simply say Pena is ignorant regarding the science rather than lying about it. However, his last story regarding the few other people who have visited the poles, to some degree, brings in to question his honesty. Michael Palin, Robert Swan and Ranulph Fiennes would all question his claim that ZERO "bipolars" have bitched about the climate. A blatant lie that Pena knows countless of his fans will spread. Research bipolars like Palin, etc then look in to Pena's eyes in the last couple of minutes of the interview. Arrogance, ignorance and outright lies from people like Pena sure make this conversation about climate difficult. I like those who speak the truth too. That's why I don't like Pena.

But what we have here is government&#39;s fake scientists who are spreading lies about global warming so they can ad more taxes like carbon tax.<br />It&#39;s illegal and all politicians and their fake scientists should be locked up in jails for global warming deception.<br />Oceans produce oxygen on Earth, not trees. If trees produce the oxygen, during winter we should all die due to lacking of air. <br />Even if all countries pay carbon taxes, will that money be used to clean the Earth? No it won&#39;t. It will end up into pockets of those rich criminals that rule the Earth.<br />There is a certain pollution caused by humans but nothing serious.<br />Rich use fear to get money from poor. Everytime if they mention end of life on Earth, that is a lie and it means rich need more money.<br />Life on Earth need CO2. Without it life will be destroyed. Earth need CO2 in large amounts and the more is produced it is better for life on Earth.<br />If rich people care about the Earth they would cleanse it and make it a better place instead of pollutinig it.

The world is destined to burn and be destroyed,<br />the world was destroyed by a flood the first time, the second is by fire. God,<br />I believe is allowing these disasters to come about as merciful warnings to His<br />creation to warn them to prepare to meet thy God Amos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0sY2tjmr_Y&amp;t=4m12s">4:12</a>. And is far as man<br />thinking they are going to live on other planets they are wasting their time<br />and billions upon billions and billions of tax payer&#39;s dollars, for no-one and<br />that means absolutely no-one is going to escape the wrath of God unless they<br />are washed in the precious blood of the precious Lamb of God , our Lord Jesus<br />Christ who was slain before the foundations of the world. People do not worry<br />about saving the planet!!!!!!! worry about asking the Lord Jesus Christ the<br />only begotten Son of the One true living God to save your soul, the world will<br />pass away and all the things therein but the Word of our living God will never<br />pass away.Glenn Johnson	UCE6SXt2Tjw5nLU4wfeg2aIA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6SXt2Tjw5nLU4wfeg2aIA	0

My thinking is that climate change is happening and once it really kicks in, we won&#39;t be able to reverse it. Why would you sit around, waiting for the dramatic to happen and refuse to believe it can, until it does and then you think &quot;...ah, should have acted sooner&quot;? There is as much evidence for climate change as there is for the link between smoking and lung cancer (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-risks-as-conclusive-as-link-between-smoking-and-lung-cancer/)">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-risks-as-conclusive-as-link-between-smoking-and-lung-cancer/)</a> yet you don&#39;t go: &quot;well, I don&#39;t have lung cancer yet so I&#39;ll continue to smoke until I do&quot;. <br />Other comments are saying that climate change is a scam. I don&#39;t believe that is true. You make more money out of oil than you can out of, say, solar panels. If you can find me something that shows people benefiting off initiatives that support the narrative of climate change more than oil, I will congratulate you.<br />I am open to civilised debates on this issue, I want to understand the other perspectives that are not my own.

He loves America and is trying to give all Americans and non-Americans who are here legally to share this Great Land with like minded people born in America. If Pelosi wants criminals let her house them, feed them, give them money, house ever how many of them to stay in her compound.. I have had it with her.

It is because of the trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere that absorb and re-emit energy that Earth’s average temperature is not permanently well below the freezing temperature of water.<br /><br />“However, one needs to distinguish between the natural greenhouse effect and the enhanced greenhouse effect. The natural greenhouse effect is caused by the natural amounts of greenhouse gases, and is vital to life. In the absence of the natural greenhouse effect the surface of the Earth would be approximately 33 degrees Celsius cooler. The enhanced greenhouse effect refers to the additional radiative forcing resulting from increased concentrations of greenhouse gases induced by human activities. The main greenhouse gases whose concentrations are rising are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and ozone in the lower atmosphere.”	UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA	0

Ugy23FChFpmVHBPXQtx4AaABAg	0	7	2019-04-12 20:04:50	Alain Poudrier	Ocean life creating carbon dioxide<br />When it comes to carbon dioxide, the human contribution pales in comparison to that of natural phenomena. Biological activity in the ocean is responsible for creating around 90 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, which is far more than the six billion tons produced by humans. The oil and coal industries might be deplorable for other reasons, but their carbon dioxide output is just a drop in the bucket. Moreover, studies show that the slight rise in carbon dioxide levels has set off a sort of “global greening” that sees new forest growth, higher food production, and better plant cover. It should go without saying that these effects are actually quite positive.<br />Solar activity is another factor that can play a big role in short-term and long-term climate change, with variations in the energy output of the sun, geomagnetic activity and sunspots contributing to the sun’s influence on the Earth’s climate.<br />Of course, we can and should do everything that we can to minimize the impact that human activity has on the environment. Studies show that while the impact humans have on the natural environment continues to grow, it is now doing so at a slower rate than the current population and economic growth, which indicates that humans are actually getting better when it comes to managing what they take from the environment. The researchers believe this could be because environmental pressures reach their highest point when industrial societies enter the early stages of their development and then slow down as markets modernize. However, there is no doubt that there is plenty more that can be done, particularly when it comes to issues like pollution and the use of toxic chemicals like glyphosate.

Lose of true blue skies, appearance of grayish, yellowish horizons, evident trails behind planes which expand into a fine mist/haze is evidence of air pollutant and it is not pollen because it is here all years long sprayed each day/night 24/7/365. This suppression of the fact that temperatures are risen is suspicious to me because it changes weather patterns and depending on location and what type of chemical they spray it can cause also droughts. The weather modification is here almost 100 years right from the beginning when first planes took off into skies.	UCHcBFqoP8LGpSN7iLIIyUAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHcBFqoP8LGpSN7iLIIyUAQ	0

Worst case scenario if we choose to listen to the climate activists: We all change our ways, stop driving each our own cars, and use public transport instead, stop flying all over the globe everytime we are bored at home, stop using poisonous pesticides, stop having massive herds of animals in totally sickening conditions, stop wasting clean water, start counting watts of electricity, use solar panels, wear woollen sweaters inside in the winter and sleep with a hat on, stop buying all this plastic one time rubbish which is polluting sea life, start eating healthy ecologically grown food, more locally and naturally grown food... Doesnt sound too bad in my opinion.<br />2. Worst case scenario if we do not listen to climate activists: We find out they were indeed right, and the opposition was indeed by people wanting to hold on to their wealth, come floods and worldwide catastrophe or not. We bring uncomprehensible sickening pain unto uncomprehensible amounts of other living breathing people, their children and grand children. For what?

REAL chemistry produces accurate, repeatable results....every time. for example - H + 2o = water.....every time. not water 1 time & apple juice the next & ice cream the next. this is why we have the scientific method....to insure science is testing & evaluating & measuring & producing valid, verifiable results......BEFORE they publicize them. whatever th ehell you think "climate science" is....it's not real science....AGW theory, which all climate science is supposedly based on, has never been subjected to the rigors of the scientific method. all climate scientists do is make predictions....that never happen....like the north pole ice free by 2013. it didn't happen.....so, either the theory is junk or the "climate scientist" is incompetent. do you understand what a scientific theory is? it's an explanation of an aspect of the natural world that can be repeatedly tested & verified according to the scientific method. this is what climate science lacks. this is why it is junk science. this is undeniable. this is not my fault. but if you think making 1000s of predictions that never happen is real science, then i dont know what to tell ya.

Data collection and analysis, and interpreting the data make up a significant part of the science. Who told you accurate(moving the goal posts in terms of accuracy is a common tactic of pseudo science and science denial) predictions are required for it to be considered science. Claims that wildly inaccurate predictions have been the norm, is yet another departure from reality. E.g. studying data on cigarette smoking and lung cancer tells us the more you smoke the more likely you are to get lung cancer. Get the world's top oncologists to tell you accurately which smoker will get lung cancer and when, and they will laugh at you. Like the human body, the climate is a complex system. (Before you pick apart my analogy, remember it's just that, an analogy). Cow farts, etc....you and I both know it's mostly about reducing emmisions from fossil fuels and developing other sources of energy. What you are alluding to is a massive conspiracy(not just a Chinese one!). Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Two things to remember: the accurate predictions stuff is nonsense and climate scientist (physicists, chemists etc) are real scientists. Best of luck to you.

"suggest a few methods"??? oh, yeah, like i've heard everything from raising taxes, to stopping cow farts to becoming vegan, to doing away with airplanes, to stopping African fertility (1 of my favorites from algore) to abolishing oil companies, to giving money to African dictators, to (another favorite) tearing down all our buildings & rebuilding them. FACT = after like 60 years, NO REAL SCIENTIFIC SOLUTION. i have yet to see even a scientific problem statement, have you? either there's no problem to be solved or it's un-solvable. the best solution to co2 emissions i know of is to plant millions of trees but as you can see on this thread, when i bring it up, all the climate bed wetters resist, even when the program is sponsored by the UN.....they believe the UN when they say we'll have 50 million climate refugees by 2010.....but not when they say go plant trees.......go figure. also, you must think about this stuff --- never in history has there been a field of (so called) science with more scandals, lies, alarmism, data tampering, fraud & it's the darling of every whacky left wing politician out there. does that tell you anything? so, bottom line = objectivity, observation & critical thinking........ i'm beginning to think it's all a gigantic farce. when i look around, i totally dont see anything happening on this planet that never happened before. we're not growing oranges in Maine, now are we? where i live, we still plant corn in May & harvest in September, as has been done from way before Europeans ever got here.

These scientists include Meteorologists, Geophysicists, Geologists, Astrophysicists, Chemists, Glaciologists, Physicists, Mathematical Physicists, etc. Some people do relatively well at school and enjoy and/or have an aptitude for science. They might study somewhere like Oxford University, etc. They choose to study physics and down the track get a PhD specifically in the area of thermodynamics. Further study and research leads to work that adds a little more to our understanding of the climate. This is not just a scenario specific to physics but to a number of other areas. A chemist, geologist, geophysicist, etc could follow a similar path eventually participating in research that contributes a little more to our understanding of the climate. At a number of points in their study they could have branched out into areas unrelated to climate science. Political, financial, etc biases aside we would expect these PhDs to better understand climate than the vast majority of the population. These scientists, no matter what their original area of expertise, are often referred to as "climate scientists". Most of their friends who studied physics or chemistry or geology, etc, with them did not go on to study the climate. We would still expect these other scientists, despite their expertise in fields unrelated to climate, to be more likely to better understand climate science than most. Someone with a PhD in thermodynamics or geophysics would be more likely to be able to read and understand the work of "climate scientists" much better than most............I won't go on. Incompetence and/or ignorance it clearly isn't. So we are left with a conspiracy! The vast majority of scientists and scientific organisations tell us that humans are contributing, to some extent, to the warming of our planet. They suggest a few measures that might help. There are many p politicians, business men and women, etc who should just have been honest from the start about how they felt about the economic and societal costs of implementing suggested changes rather than relying on denial, uncertainty and conspiracy theories.

I briefly read something saying it had been increasing for a few years to about 2016 but then it had started decreasing over the last couple of years. I guess plenty of scientists, particularly climate scientists, have been aware of this. If there was only a choice of yes or no to your questions of "trust" I would answer yes, as much as I trust most people. I can trust the scientific work they produce more so because of the way science and scientists have worked now and recently. Having been interested in science for as long as I have, I understand what it would require for such a conspiracy to be possible. On your last point. I know next to nothing about Antarctic ice, so for me to try to interpret what moving a station because of growing ice meant would be a stretch. I guess for someone(not saying you are necessarily this someone) who believes the earth is not warming, I would guess they might interpret this as a small bit of evidence in support of their beliefs.

I wasn't necessarily interested in what Fiennes had to say about our climate, I was simply presenting him as someone who Pena was wanting you to believe doesnt "bitch" about climate science. My point was about Pena's trustworthiness. There are people who, like you, genuinely think they have good reason to believe climate science is wrong and I don't have any reason to think you are lying. Pena however, has been caught out in a lie. Why make up the story about zero people bitching about climate change? You yourself briefly read what Fiennes had to say. Why was Pena so misleading?

DUH. other than that, i dont know what he thinks is happening now that never happened before. he's supposed to have walked across antarctica but never mentioned that the ice there is increasing. he explored the Arctic but never mentioned that when the US atomic sub Skate surfaced at the north pole it was in a lake, open water.....when? in frikkin 1955....check it out, they took pictures. oh, yeah & he said he'd be glad to meet with Trump to talk about fighting climate change like Trump controls the climate & is stopping him from fighting climate change? how much fossil fuel did Sir Ran burn up in his travels? i'm not impressed by Fiennes. i think he's just another blowhard spewing platitudes like "we should behave ourselves better". whaddays wanna bet he never planted a tree or did one single thing to fight climate change??

I'm happy to hear a little more about him if you think what he has to say is or was significant but I'm assuming we don't hear much about him anymore because he has been hysterical and/or relatively ignorant on the topic.

I don't like to think of myself as closed minded and I guess you don't either, so I presume you've researched Sir Ranulph Fiennes, etc. You said a quite firm goodbye so I don't expect you to reply and I won't dig deep in to the discussion you originally wanted to have if you don't want to now.

There is much in your comment I disagree with and the massive differences between our understanding and perception of the issue certainly points to something dodgy going on. Just a couple of questions. What's your science background and how would you explain his "bipolar" story at the end of the video? I know little about Pena but I would guess he is relatively competent and clever in a number of areas, so I find it hard to believe it was an honest error. He theatrically and emphatically says zero of the 10 (it wouldn't surprise me if a number of 10 is inaccurate) "bitch" about climate change. It would surprise me if, of these 10, he has not heard a few of them publicly voice their concerns about our climate. 3(there may be more) of these "ten" are Michael Palin, Ranulph Fiennes and Robert Swan. Imagine these three men questioning him, rightfully so, about his bipolar story. Is Pena the type of human being who would apologise for his fabricated story or would he try to debate what he meant by "bitch" and deny any wrong doing? Do you think this type of screw-up(I'm being generous) would be a bizarre thing for an honest intelligent person to do in front of such a large audience? Do you think Pena has any idea how many of his trusting fans will be repeating his false bipolar story? Many of his other statements are misleading and irresponsible but his last story is the easiest to fact check.

Toss in few ice cubes, until the water level is flushed with the rim. Let all the ice melt completely. See if liquid overflow. Water is a unique substance that increases in volume when frozen. Now, look at Earth Globe, manufactured to scale. Compare the volume of water in polar ice caps to volume of water in World Ocean. Imagine impact on the world sea level of ice caps quietly melted. I think &quot;zilch&quot; is the word? <br />Carbon Dioxide is the heaviest component of our atmosphere. To say that it somehow gets into upper layers of atmosphere is insincere, at least. Factory chimneys are made very tall to allow CO2 to disperse, while FALLING DOWN to the ground.	UCI_9IyhVxD7Y11bEzq2Dz4g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI_9IyhVxD7Y11bEzq2Dz4g	0

I don't drive a car . What I do know is that idiots like you rant and rave at those you call climate change deniers ( I've never met one of those )and yet you can't even be bothered to leave your car at home for a couple of days a week , or even switch a light off .

The house was built about 125 years ago and the present owner is 4th generation of the family who built the house. I am 61 years old and have been visiting the house since I was about 6 yrs old the high tide still comes to the same place as it has always done. So no rise in sea levels. I also have spent a lot of my free time fishing on various piers since childhood and in some 55 years have seen no increase in tide levels on these piers. Some 20 years ago the so called climate experts predicted that the sea level would grow by 15 feet. If that had happened my friends house would have been destroyed and I would be unable to go fishing on my favourite piers. So a lot of experts have been proven to have been wrong.

The same Nations with the lowest footprint? Why is it about money in the first place? It is also very interesting that the money goes to companies where the pushers of this hoax are invested in. Why not encourage people to invest in "clean energy" themselfs? That way, no tax and they are able to earn a profit. Why isn't it proposed that you get stocks of those companies in return for your tax payment? Why just steal the money?

If you want I can pull up UN predictions from 15, 20 & 30 yrs ago where the "experts" you talk of make absurd predictions that were 100% wrong/nowhere near even slightly accurate. Just because someone says they're an "expert" doesn't mean it's true....CNN for example was touting Bill Nye (the science guy) as an actual scientist...He's not, he's nothing but an actor who plays the role of a nerdy scientist on PBS kids TV shows....They chose him to play the part only because he looked like a nerdy scientist....But stupid gullible people then believe he's an actual scientist.

Pull my head out of my arse? #1 none of their past "the experts" doomsday predictions came true #2 If true then why wouldn't they lead by example instead of doing the exact opposite and emitting 100 times more CO2 than the average person.#3 all the polar ice is still there #4 why are these "experts" no longer concerned or mentioning the 2 dangerous giant ozone layer holes supposedly causing global warming?#5 if CO2 global warming is true then that means the same people "rich globalists in power running the world" telling you it's true, literally don't care and are actually the one's doing most of the polluting. They could cheaply convert all cars on the road to run off propane reducing a huge amount of emissions and also cheaply build homes super insulated using inexpensive air crete drastically reducing heating & cooling costs and CO2 emissions...Also if global warming is such a huge issue why is it the zoning board won't allow me to collect my own rainwater, put up a wind turbine and build a super cheap,strong,well insulated home using air crete that is non toxic and non flammable...They scream global warming yet at the same time prevent me from going green and emitting less CO2 because they of course want to tax CO2 along with my electric,water and gas usage...I think it's you who needs to pull your head out of your arse.

Reporters flew over his big home in CO and noticed he had no solar or wind turbines on his mansion property and asked him why? So he rushed out and had a small solar system installed a week later...

These were the same "experts" who now say it's from CO2 "trapping the heat in" and not the doomsday holes letting heat through.I'm guessing you're an AOC fan and believes her when she says the world is going to end in 12 years, unless we emit a ton more CO2 by remodeling every building on the planet...lol How are these "experts" gonna remodel every building without using a ton of natural resources and emitting tons more CO2? Meanwhile they're all using fossil fuels,creating more waste and emitting way more "CO2" than the average person.. The "experts" also said back in the 70's & 80's that there would be no more oil left by 2020....The "experts" also warned us about Y2K...How are they going to stop the volcano's from emitting CO2? So was it man made climate change that melted the 2 mile thick glaciers 10,000 years ago, that covered 3/4 of north america? I believe 7 billion humans do play a role in climate change but why are they so focused on CO2 when what will actually kill us off 1st is toxic pollution poisoning the air, water & soil. All the plastic and pollution being dumped into the oceans destroying ecosystems...Loss of natural resources,etc...they're "more concerned about CO2" lol the suff you exhale when you breath...How is a tax gonna solve the problem anyways ? You can emit all the CO2 you want if you pay the tax...Think about that, they don't say, "you can dump all the lead & mercury into the water you want as long as you pay your lead & mercury tax"	UCOQi2dEhIXPo4Db7rqyPV6w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOQi2dEhIXPo4Db7rqyPV6w	1	UgwGLf3fwC9DP-kMavR4AaABAg	Kelly McGowan

NASA has recently reported that the plantation on earth actually increased from the level at early 21st century and most of the increase was contributed by CHINA and INDIA. Compared to India, where greening mostly comes from increasing corp planation, greening in China comes mostly from tree planting. Alibaba Group, the Chinese E-bay / Amazon, has one application called &quot;Ants&#39; Forest&quot; on its PayPal like online payment platform that promotes its users to perform green activities (walking, taking buses, etc) to generate &quot;green energy&quot;. This &quot;energy&quot;, if not used to plant trees, will disappear the following days. In this case, &quot;Ants&#39; forest&quot; and its 230 million users, have grown over 10.25 million trees since August 2016 in Northwest part of China that assist local communities to stop the expansion of desert.

Think about such a way: There is no &quot;capital&quot; or &quot;given interest&quot;, there is only my attention or effort to do things multiplies the productivity of the tool / tech I used = final production I get. Because tomorrow someone will invent a better tool or tech and make my today&#39;s production value decreasing, I would rather spend it out (eat the apple now or trade it for a sprout to grow another tree). In this way, there is no burden of increasing demand of returns that suppress actual needs, technical advances mean more production and expenditure for all of us thus demand naturally aligns with the production. (Only human has needs that drives demand and therefore production, will any piece of greenback, despite been created to measure the value, creates demand by itself?)

Without solving the &quot;labor cost&quot; issue, and also the &quot;given value&quot; issue, the problem is only going to get bigger, and eventually causing the &quot;starving and losing&quot; class to become radical, taking more irrational thinking (blaming immigrants, blaming global trading) and embracing nationalism (quit global cooperation effort, such as the Paris treaty). We can clearly see such trend in many developed countries. In its extreme, if more radical governments elected, and global cooperation reverted, the largest debt in human history collapse, we may see through another world war.

To fulfill such exponentially growing demand of returns, capitalists have to constantly find ways to increase demand and reduce cost, thus maximize the profit. Unfortunately, this includes treating human labor as a cost, which then created a dilemma between the increasing need of expenditure (i.e. demand) and reducing abilities to spend. Such dilemma caused many economic crises and two world wars on human history, but was solved by the introduction of modern finance.

This goes back to capitalism that dominates the world economy and political structure for centuries. Before capitalism, human production was transformed and stored in wealth to counter for disasters, which were rarely used to increase productivity due to no motivation for the owners to do so; however, capitalism solved the problem by creating an artificial universal agreed return (or the interest) on the stored wealth, and motivated the owners (nobles) to use their wealth to create more wealth (by investing). Since then it promoted technological advancements and social transformation that increase productivity for humanity to proliferate.

And how much is actually based on you looking at climate records for the pst 50,000 years, the scientific literature., etc? In other words, are you aware of any of the counter evidence to the argument? By the way, the media, public school, researchers in favor of the man made global warming/climate change idea are all funded directly or indirectly by the government who has been in favor of the global warming agenda for the last 10-20 years. If they don’t toe the line and parrot what the govt says, they lose out on their funding. It’s a scam, look into the counter evidence. The temperature graphs used mostly as evidence only go back to 1880, which was the end of an abnormally cold period known as what scientist call the “Little Ice age”. In the year 1880, the glaciers were the largest and also the temps were the lowest they had been since the last ice age 10000- 12000 years ago. The graph is comparing apples to oranges and blaming it on humans.	UCipzlep0qv7ZLkFonZr-Nsg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipzlep0qv7ZLkFonZr-Nsg	1	Ugy0pLHkgK_c0XHdugp4AaABAg	Steven Wang

Ocean acidification occurs when CO2 is absorbed in the ocean. When these changes happen quickly plants and animals cant adjust fast enough and eco systems are damaged. The climate has always been changing. However normally not at this speed. The few times we have seen temperature acceleration at this speed is almost always ends in damage.

If anybody can remember when we were in high school and we went to science class our teacher told us that the earth is a living breathing organism. Now that being said the earth will change constantly and that is called evolving! The planet started off as one thing and continued to grow into another thing. This will not change overtime . Our planet will constantly go through changes ice will melt waters will increase land will become less not because of greenhouse gas . But because of growth. If we were to listen to Al Gore the world would be at an end right now. He was wrong. Let&#39;s just say the planet is going to end in 12 years. After over 100 years of greenhouse gas is carbon monoxide do you honestly think 12 years of none of this will save the planet? I mean let&#39;s go along with your premises the earth is damaged you cannot fix it so how by stopping all of what you say needs to be done is going to save our lives. In conclusion it will not change anything 12 years will not take away over 100 years of damage according to your assumptions. It is Ludacris to think the world will end in 12 years. And the person that&#39;s says this should be checked for mental instability!	UCLJQegT-80UAd71z0FE3H7w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLJQegT-80UAd71z0FE3H7w	0

His method of refuting it is utterly unconvincing, and I’m totally in the guy’s corner!<br />He doesn’t have to yell or swear or interrupt people to convince them... <br />The very first time I heard about the US ‘guv’mint’s’ “brilliant” one-size-fits-all “solution” to climate change, I was skeptical— even more so when European governments began pushing their “solution” in a big way... but the MOMENT Barry Soetoro tried ramming it down America’s throat, demanding that the “carbon tax” be initiated IMMEDIATELY (“..we don’t have TIME to discuss it! It’s TOO critical! Has to be done RIGHT AWAY! Don’t even LOOK! Call your representatives and tell them to pass the law NOW!!..”), I knew instantly, it was a scam. <br />Nothing environmental is THAT urgent, so I knew right away the purpose for the tax was sinister. Done deal. <br />At BEST, it is a massive wealth redistribution scheme. But even more likely, it’s a way to concentrate wealth in the federal government, and rapidly build an enforcement bureaucracy that would guarantee a couple of things: First, it would make the federal government overwhelmingly wealthy and powerful by putting control of massive, continual cash flow in their hands, allowing them to impose draconian penalties to make the windfall cash flow to government PERMANENT; second, it would then be possible to fine-tune the “carbon tax” — to make certain that there would never again be another ‘Donald Trump’– it could be tailored to fleece America of any disposable income that might be used for free-market mischief, but even worse– it could be targeted specifically at ANY business or individual, to penalize and confiscate a greater percentage of the wealth of, say, a classification of businesses, or a specific geographic region, or even an individual business— because it’s “higher productivity” or fuel use, or water use, or garbage output, etc.— translates to “greater environmental impact,” which (of course) justifies higher government ‘fees,’ or ‘carbon tax.’<br />I hope you can see just how EASY it will be to put such a system in place after getting the tax started– because then, investing in indoctrinating young people via public education is SIMPLE, as will be getting them to grow up accepting such tripe. <br />The reason government bureaucrats and “researchers” are so protective of the concept is NOT that the “sky is falling,” but that even a little constant opposition can just as easily ruin their “get-rich-and-powerful-quick” plan.<br />So– WATCH for continued and increasing calls for silencing, even PROSECUTING, people who “deny” the orthodoxy of climate change– and beware. <br />We hear it already. “Do you BELIEVE in climate change?” NO?!? BURRRN HIM!!”<br />It’s pathetic, and terrifying, to see people willing to punish and jail people who don’t buy the flimsy argument that there’s “97% consensus” proving climate science is “real.” ...So? What’s that mean?<br />Nobody cares at that point in the conversation– you’ve proven yourself a heretic, deserving of punishment. <br />What is especially concerning is that even now, you don’t get to utter the next thought you had in mind, which is that the proposed “solution” seems FAR too simple, too convenient, and too darn expensive to be reasonable, because the free market can much more efficiently find various solutions in time. <br />But you’ll never get those words out of your mouth, before the Leftist social justice warriors shout you down and denounce you with the near-religious fervor that only those absolutely certain of their moral superiority can invoke. <br />If the “climate disaster” mantra were TRUE, it would simply prove itself over time– but IT ISN’T GOING TO. It never has, because the trends they predict are NOT caused by what they CLAIM is causing it. So the Leftists have to “sell” the idea, HARD and FAST, in order to convince society to give them control of all your wealth, before their predictions are once again proven to be complete fairy dust, just as Al Gore’s inconvenient vain imaginings were back in the ‘80’s and ‘90’s...<br />We have TIME to allow the free market to create new technology, without having to submit to a Communist government to get it done and “save the world.” <br />Don’t fall for the totalitarian Leftist’s plan to get you to bite the poison apple— I’m PRAYING people aren’t that stupid— because once you give them a little control, they will spring the trap, and you’ll never be free again.<br />“Climate change” has little or nothing to do with improving the environment, and everything to do with taking control of the government. <br />Yes, some people ARE that evil and devious.

There&#39;s more of them having their homes, businesses, towns - lives, destroyed every month. Deniers don&#39;t prepare because who would prepare for something they think is a hoax? Oh well it&#39;s way too late now and preparing may or may not postpone your suffering, but there is no avoiding climate judgement now. We were never going to stop - that goes against natural law, but further denial endures that no resources (your tax dollars) need be spent preparing fir the inevitable record breaking disasters to come. Besides your overlord oligarchs need another trillion dollar tax cut even if it means your kids &amp; grand kids suffer and die earlier than need be.<br /><br />&#39;Midwest flooding highlights national security risk posed by climate change&#39;<br /><br /><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/midwest/ct-flooding-climate-change-20190322-story.html">https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/midwest/ct-flooding-climate-change-20190322-story.html</a>	UCq6M2RmPpDib65ovMP8Yrwg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq6M2RmPpDib65ovMP8Yrwg	0

You may be interested to know that CO2 does not cause Global Warming. If you look at the video on my channel you will see that when you surround a white hot filament with CO2 it cools. There is no warming mechanism at play. Just like there is no warming mechanism acting on the surface at play when CO2 is present in the atmosphere. This debunking of the greenhouse effect is undisputable.	UCKc3n4c9VYS68jZMJsjNgFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKc3n4c9VYS68jZMJsjNgFA	1	Ugy-S21FWwoiBPzlqbh4AaABAg	Rex Johnson

Also the people who supports this they say &quot;it is due to capitalism and oil companies that some people denies global warming&quot; YET!!!! The same Energy companies who supports global warming and also govts are charging premiums for the use of green energy not the other way around. In fact, now that cars emissions are wayyyy cleaner than 20 years ago... they are finding ways to TAX cars that aren&#39;t even using Petrol hahahahaahaha.

The mountains, rivers and forests, etc are there for a reason. Start moving them around and you will no doubt change the weather in that area and other places. Remember the dust bowl ? Had nothing to do with climate or people polluting. Had everything to do with people tearing the land up and removing the covering. Thus you get gigantic dust storms that destroy even more. Still happens in places today. No doubt USA gets hit by all of these hurricanes because the way Africa is. The strip where desert meets forest is where they are generated from. Fix that and you fix the hurricanes. Fix the desert and you fix the sand storms. Then again, what do I know.	UClgeyy1cFfRDdz2RnY-z34Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClgeyy1cFfRDdz2RnY-z34Q	0

However, most of the world&#39;s liquid hydrocarbons are and were created continuously from carbonaceous hydrates left over from the (electric plasma-governed) formation of the Earth. Gravitational separation had some relatively minor role to play in this concentration, as well. In any case, the major oil and natural gas fields of Earth are all self-replenishing. It will take us hundreds of thousands of years to run out of oil and natural gas, even at our current outrageous rates of use.

A handful of the finest weather scientists just reviewed the practices of field scientists and found the testing procedures were flawed. In one case they were collecting the substrates and then pressurizing them, using the data to say how much CO2 and methane was released in a set time period. Some of the solar charts the NOAA and UN released had the solar storms removed. So when then chart was laid next to warming charts it set off false alarms. Here are two more: "a top NOAA climate scientist selectively used data to discredit the global warming hiatus in a key 2015 study." Another scientist "checked the published temperature graphs for three weather stations in Paraguay against the temperatures that had originally been recorded. In each instance, the actual trend of 60 years of data had been dramatically reversed, so that a cooling trend was changed to one that showed a marked warming." The GHCN, GISS, and NCDC were also checked, "In each case he found the same suspicious one-way “adjustments”"	UCzbuIphXdjykhBKdp6g6p_Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbuIphXdjykhBKdp6g6p_Q	1	UgzVxzWFm8eEjyTFjjN4AaABAg	Rebecca Knight

Just few questions for now, and please don't feel any pressure to answer. Have you read the climate statements from many of the world's scientific organisations? Here are snippets from a few: The American Physical Society: "...multiple lines of evidence indicate that human influences have had an increasingly dominant effect on global climate warming…" The Royal Society: "Human emissions over the last two centuries have altered the composition of the Earth's atmosphere. As a result, more of the Sun's heat is retained..." Australian Academy of Science: "Most of the observed recent global warming results from human activities" European Academy of Sciences: "With current trends in greenhouse gas emissions, a global average temperature increase of over 3°C above pre-industrial levels is projected by the end of the century" Would you be happy to stand up in front of the 50000 physicists of the APS, or 12000 (minus a couple of dozen) members of the Geological Society of London or......etc and explain to them why they are "fucking fools"?

You just bite in because it look tasty. Yes, the weather is a rubber band effect. The faster the core moves the longer it takes to respond and the harsher the climate becomes. By your own words "200 year days" is like your memory of that time. Its Non existent. We have no real data but about a hundred years. And of that the strong data we have only since the 80s have we had computer help. And of that only very recently has the tech been good enough to amount any real data. So yesterday, but you still accept all the lies. Go reread my first comment. You are way off as is millions of sheeple. They just found a cave in Antarctica that twisted the ice core data. They found their info was all wrong from ice cores due to these caves that form. Melting upper shelve refreezes on the bottom and is shifted around often. Causing core data to be as much BS as Carbon dating.	UCzbuIphXdjykhBKdp6g6p_Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbuIphXdjykhBKdp6g6p_Q	1	UgzVxzWFm8eEjyTFjjN4AaABAg	Rebecca Knight

NOTHING. You are a fucking FOOL. You put temperature charts next to geomagnetic shift charts and you too can see the exact cause of weather changes. The core of the Earth effects close to 95% of all weather on this planet. It dosent work on its own but in step with the sun and other stuff we dont yet understand like dark matter and our gravitational field.

The aim is to prevent 3rd world countries from developing, bring hordes of migrant workers from those countries into 1st world countries which subsequently keeps the wage rate down and enables the globalists to keep their family empires running at little to no cost. This leads us to Agenda 21/30 - get you paying carbon tax, living in cramped inner city high rises, competing for space, destroying the middle class, 5g surveillance, while climate change affected areas (coastlines, bushy suburbs) slowly become 'forbidden zones' deemed too dangerous to live in all just keep the masses 'contained'. They will win too if enough people don't wake up in time. Look at NZ, Canada...... Too late for them.

The facts are that the democratic party and the main stream media -the establishment- has been attacking him for Russian collusion ever since he won his presidency. The establishment rigged an election so that Hillary Clinton would win the primaries -superdelagates, Debbie w. Schultz playing favorites and resigning. The establishment pits movie stars against our president to influence the idolatrous. The list goes on but I dont have time to spell it out for you. What I do know is that the economy is booming under a Donald Trump presidency for all Americans and the people who are upset about it make me question, why?? Anyways it sounds like you got your info from Vox, and Vox was exposed from Wikileaks for working for Hillary Clinton. People like you are easily manipulated by hit pieces. You need to look at the big picture. One day you will understand.	UCVhqT3nTIY69OBDJLEYyhww	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVhqT3nTIY69OBDJLEYyhww	1	Ugy0794bA9oNrYt007R4AaABAg	AlmostBipedal

Your child(our planet) needs urgent life saving brain surgery. 90, 95, 97% (exact numbers are not particularly significant but let&#39;s say a majority at least) of the world&#39;s top brain surgeons(climate scientists)suggest procedure A, a minority of the brain surgeons suggest procedure B. Although not their area of speciality, all other surgeons(all other scientists)are asked their opinion and the vast majority agree procedure A is the best course of action. What type of ignorant arrogant parent thinks that a couple of weeks research could be enough for them to roll the dice on such an important decision and go with surgery B?<br />ARROGANT IGNORANT IRRESPONSIBLE!!!

Back in the mid 1980&#39;s (10,11 yrs old) I remember being taught in grade school that all the oil in the world would be gone before we reached 25 yrs old. That our children would never know of gasoline powered cars.<br /><br /><br />Public Education = Political Indoctrination.

Human history means since the time when we learned to write. You are talking about 25000 years ago. The first writing appeared in Sumeria in the 5th millenium B.C.E.; 2) Asians crossing the frozen Bering Strait directly counters what you think it means --- it means that the Bering Sea was frozen over, not navigable.

Someday, whether a million years, or hundred thousand, or thousand, or 100, or maybe tomorrow, all this, everything that Is, Was, or Would Be, on this Earth, will be erased from history. It will be as if it never was. Some cosmological incident will probably reduce the Earth to it's elementary particles. Maybe the Sun swallows us, or galaxies collide, or the fabric of space-time tears apart, or collapses down into an infinite point. Or a big, giant rock just falls out of the sky and pulverizes the planet to bits. Or some Deity or Virtual Simulation Programmer says, I'm bored, game over. Or maybe, the Earth dodges all calamity, and gets to experience heat death as the Universe approaches absolute zero. Everything we ever knew, loved, trusted and believed in will be forever erased from time, space, and all existence; as if it never existed in the first place. And that is absolutely beautiful. The Big Secret; the Meaning of Life, the Universe and Everything is absolutely Nothing. Meaning itself, Meaningless. I find that comforting, in a disturbing kinda way. {Just go with the flow; don't fight it.} Some people are afraid of not existing. I think that is odd. I mean, I have already not existed prior to my existence. And I probably Not Existed, for a really, really long time; a lot longer time than the time I have existed. It's nothing new. So, It should be familiar. Maybe like, coming home. Honestly, it should be Existing that is terrifying, not, Not Existing. TLDR: eat, drink, and drive an SUV, for tomorrow we get crushed by a giant space rock or something. Of course, I could be wrong. This could be the extended, editor's cut, special edition of Groundhog Day and it just repeats over, and over, and over, and over. In which case, Yee Shall be Judged! There are cameras everywhere, aaannnd we just saw that, what you did there. Sheesh, talk about terrifying. Have great weekend everyone. Unless a giant space rock falls on you.

It's the bureaucratic policies that the government is trying to force on us is what I completely disagree with. You don't need a force taxes on us just to improve technology of third party companies. in fact if you look at a lot of the groups that these carbon tax dollars go to. You discover they're pocketing at least more than half of it. While a small percentage is actually going to where they claim it's going. And a lot of it is actually just going to pet research projects that go absolutely nowhere.

However the rate that temperatures have been warming are unprecedented and have rarely been observed in nature; even when they are they usually end in extinction and environmental damage. In the past we have seen temperature rise of 1 degree per every 1000 years. Today we are seeing 1 degree per every 100 years. Pretty big change. We aren’t accelerating warming because there shouldn’t by any warming in the first place. We are the direct cause of warming. It shouldn’t be warming right now. Solar activity is decreasing, volcanoes are increasing, and no other factors except for the CO2 we are causing could be causing it. We know the carbon that’s being added is from humans because the isotope carbon 13 is decreasing in our atmosphere. Fossil fuels have less carbon 13 then naturally in our atmosphere, therefor the sudden drop is very likely to be caused by our release of CO2. We will lose land from warming climate. More than 90% of warming goes into our oceans. When water gets warmer, like every other single element, it will expand which causes sea level rise. Ice melting on land also runs off into oceans which causes increase in sea level. We have also already seen rising sea levels cause loss of land on low lying islands.

I am concerned about the effects of overpopulation, deforestation and pollution, maybe each country should do their part on those, but a global carbon tax won&#39;t do a thing but make a handful of people a lot richer, scamming billions of dollars from unwilling countries around the globe- mostly developed ones- who already have strict environmental regulations.

I have done the research you should do some yourself because you've obviously been brainwashed. NASA says that humans only account for 10% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. One volcanic eruption puts out more greenhouse gases than the entire United States does in one year. The same Highly Educated idiots who are pitching this earth worshipping garbage also claim that the Earth is millions of years old and yet volcanoes have been erupting on it the entire time so you do the math. Saying that humans are responsible for global warming is complete and total BS and there is nothing to substantiate it. It's more likely that it has something to do with the solar cycle for which again humans have no control over whatsoever.

We still need non- renewable energy to make renewables, but will destroy the legacy of the industrialists. Their monopolies will die and transfer power to another group. On the other hand green energy will control everything too, or will it free us from them? Tesla project was killed. We could have free electric at this point. All these wars are over oil. The mega elite industrialists want to own all of it. On the other hand we still need fossil fuels. And if green energy was to become normal, we&#39;d either be further controlled or freed.

This guy Dan Pena is right yes the world is getting colder because that is the effect . In 1913 over 100 years ago the world recorded its hottest ever day in recorded history 57.6 degrees Celsius that temperature has never been recorded ever again , which means the world is getting colder , something you all should wake up and realise as well never in the history of this planet has extinction level occurred from the planet warming “ice ages “ were the known cause of extinctions ! When you all realise that blaming bush fires a few hot days in the year as it meaning global warming and the end is coming then you are all completely misled on what you really know	UCkB3mg_fKhpcQmUqUIEk6mg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkB3mg_fKhpcQmUqUIEk6mg	0

To those of you that are scientifically literate this is self-explanatory but I will explain for those of you that are not. Any scientist that says an exponential growth of CO2 in a biosphere with an ozone is not a bad thing is not a scientist or is speaking on behalf of an ideological agenda. It&#39;s okay that Dan Pena is ignorant on this. But it should not be overlooked and it should be understood that he was not able to answer or conceptualize this truth. The scientists he quoted that said CO2 emissions don&#39;t matter to a biosphere we&#39;re lying and the science is open source for anyone to go see. I hope some of you wake up rather than hopping on the bandwagon. Thank you	UCRgKokFiWTCosfDEAB45VDQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRgKokFiWTCosfDEAB45VDQ	0

Sea rise is at 1mm to 3mm thickness of a dime per year(now) and its been rising even more for thousands of years. Oh ,ozone holes are only at the poles, they are seasonal and cyclical created by the sun. You are the one with the ideological agenda, do some research.

Addley	To all the &quot;smart people&quot; on this comment section: you know better! <br />But if you don’t: <br />- Next time that you feel sick don’t go to the doctor…go to the sorcerer <br />- Next time that you need antibiotics because you risk to die…pray! <br />- Next time you need to go to work…use a horse <br />- Next time you want to turn on the light...light a fire in your living room with two rocks <br />- Next time insects are devouring your crops…spit on them <br />- Don’t educate your children: math, chemistry, etc. It’s all bullshit <br />Engineers, Chemists, Astronomers, Ethologists, Botanists, Agronomists, Astrophysicists, and so on, are the same people that are saying something strange is happening, 97% of the academic consensus, the same people that invented medications, that cure diseases, that allow you to have a shelter on your head and not freeze to death, the same people that invented your car and all the shitty things you use today, even this fucking comment section. <br />Now, the next time you “watch like a proud moron the first man on the moon”, if you follow Dan Pena logic, be aware of the fact that maybe they were lying to you because you think they are doing it now. <br />But the real problem here is not the fact that you don’t believe it, it’s the fact that you have nothing to lose “believing it” and everything to lose “not believing it”. How many earths do you think you have? Do you think that natural resources will last forever without any impact on the environment? In 1927 the earth&#39;s population was 2 billion, in 2050 will be 9.5 billion. Do you think that nothing will happen cause of that? <br /><br /><br />But who you choose to believe? A con artist found on youtube, a scammer that brags about money he never made (Tony Robbins like many other could say that he is the 100 billion dollar man, the 1000 billion dollar man), no proof whatsoever of any kind, no papers, nothing. The only real money he makes comes from his seminars, propped by controversy on arguments like this on London Real (fake). <br />Now, ask yourself: <br />- How many other real rich people do you know that are like Dan Pena, with so much “time to waste helping” others and making a huge amount of money at the same time? <br />- And how many other real rich people, demonstrably rich people, that are all the opposite of Dan Pena do you know?<br />- How many real rich people do you know that feel the need to show their cars and castle so much, full of stuffed animals?<br />- Is there anyone out there that says exactly the things Dan Pena says? Ever you ever watched other motivational speakers? <br />- Why does he endorses someone like Trump (whatever you think of him and whoever you voted for) that is the opposite of the Dan Pena’s model of the achiever? Trump got reformed thanks to his daddy, he lied about his wealth many and many times to get more money, scammed people with his university, he is a lazy fuck that don’t believe in working out spending all his time playing golf, he is a pathological liar, he went bankrupt many times and received his money from his daddy, hundreds of millions, where Dan Pena says that he won’t give anything to his children, they are not his responsibility, the opposite Trump is doing with his own children. <br />- If you know that something is profitable, if you know how to make a huge amount of money, if you can forecast market’s opportunities, would you be out there wasting time with other people? No, you need to have a reason and that reason is “money”. <br />You know better!	UCxlOzMyPNAXwTiB1BZ_QJcQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxlOzMyPNAXwTiB1BZ_QJcQ	0

So it doesn&#39;t take a genius to realise that ice has melted before. Thousands of years ago. So what caused that? The CO2 from 4 wheel drives, coal power stations etc. Farting bovines.

Taxes are not pleasant but necessary, you don't feel their effects on your skin like the money in your pocket because you are used to it. Especially in Canada, try to imagine that tommorow you will have the same healthcare system that there is in US with less taxes in exchange. Just guessing but the hell will break loose. The representative system is not perfect, we all know that (corruption, lobbying, etc.), but unfortunately it's the only one we have, the only thing that really worked until now. Maybe one day, when we will have a chip in our head that make us vote istantaneously on everything. In general, my personal opinion is that gradually we should switch from fossil energy to other sources, even renouncing a little to our standards of living if we need to. It's difficult considering we are selfish creatures that think only about the timespan of our lives but resources are finite, coal is finite, oil is finite and they won't "grow" anymore, exausted pretty soon, we are talking about a few "decades". But even if we are selfish creatures, our children and grandchildren will pay the consequences of whatever we decide to do now, that's for sure.

Usually, the government taxes pollution so that you can have clean water, rivers, lakes, air, because the market doesn't allocate efficiently "public goods". Try to drink a can of oil and see by yourself if taxes against pollution of aquifers can be a good thing. Now, democracy works like this. You go to vote and elect the government, the government makes laws that you must follow. For the transitive property, we can derive to things: 1) You are the government and make laws on your own through representatives 2) There are more people that want to pay taxes at the purpose of having services than people that don't want to pay taxes (but still, "free riding" those services like roads, military, police, firerighters, etc.) So, if you don't want to pay taxes go to another country or push for a government change. The real thing you should ask to yourself is why you pay the same amount of taxes or more than people that make 1 billion dollars. Maybe if you pay taxes you can't afford bread. If they pay taxes they can't afford another 20 million dollar house. Think about that.

The issue is that it&#39;s SUPPOSED to change and it&#39;s not a problem that needs correcting. It might lead to changes in weather and sea levels but that&#39;s part of nature, deal with it. The Earth has been in a constant state of flux since its birth. The whole of recorded human history is a blink of an eye on a geological scale, and the amount of time we&#39;ve been taking scientific measurements is even more minuscule. The only relevant data we have to draw from is that which is found in the geological record, which also happens to show that nothing is wrong at all...

What does it mean in this context? Do you know that the earth is populated by 7.5 billion people and that, let's say 160 million are maybe liberals in US and that a lot more are somewhat worried about global warming/climate change (between 60-70%)? Over 190 countries agree on climate change, 97% academic consensus. What a fuck are you talking about? It's the "rate" the problem and not the level. If you want to make some kind of scientific argument, write a peer reviewed article. Otherwise leave that to scientists. And if you don't agree with me, next time you feel sick don't go to the doctor...pray! What a fuck does a doctor know? What makes you think that you or those coal/energy lobbist fuckers that have been in charge of EPA are more intelligent than the whole world? What do you think it's more probable between you being wrong and corporations trying to mislead people at the purpose of making more and more money without consequences? What do you think is more reliable, a kind of government that doesn't esitate to lie even when it needs to invade another country for a can of oil or the whole world and 97% of scientists? What scientists say it is not debatable, scientists work one against the other to disprove each other most of the times. So, if there is consensus you must be really fucking worried.

It&#39;s so easy to shift blame on mankind for causing GW when it&#39;s the corporations creating the products (eg. Gas vehicles) that contribute to it. If GW was real, companies would immediately curtail their products and change, but....THEY DON&#39;T. Why? They don&#39;t want to lose money and yet they want to dictate how we live and suck more money from the poor.	UCwAvNlbmw-p2loHHOWb6I5g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwAvNlbmw-p2loHHOWb6I5g	0

You have to be utterly ignorant and stupid to not see what a money making machine this is and how well its marketing propaganda was all over the globe. Probably 90% of these companies who make their money with &quot;green energy&quot; would make absolut zero money without the global warming propaganda. Its the same like with TVs, they always have to invent something new to get new buyers for their products. Are humans poluting the world? Absolutely and they need to stop with it, but they re not responsible for global warming which existed hundred thousands of years before, but the problem about stupid humans poluting the world is being blown up so that a lot of companies can make money from it.<br /><br /><br />How is that? Its always the group/area/products targeted where one can make money off eventhough this area doesnt make anything wrong. Example? Cars. In alot industry nations in europe ovens for keeping the house warm make triple or even more of the polution than all cars together. But do you see any government or partys going against it? No one does, because you cant milk money from them, but you can milk the car owners. <br />Cruise industry. One cruiser polutes more than 100k cars. Do any of these green propaganda idiots go against this industry like they do against cars? No they dont, because there doesnt lay any money. Car buyers got the money. Few years ago it was the smokers, but they ve been drained to extinction.<br /><br /><br />I know some whimp snowflakes will always ignore these things, because they re obesessed with their agenda where no logic is needed anymore. A lot goes wrong on this world like throwing garbage into ocean etc. all these things needs to be stopped. But the global warming is a swindle, which doesnt mean everything is perfect in this world, but it is probably the biggest money making scam the world has ever seen and too much companies and countries profit from them, so everyone will just play their role and spread more drama over the mainstream media to make you feel bad so you buy their overpriced &quot;green&quot; products.

So why not take the word of a Burger King manager or this a-hole conglomerate in a pin strip suit? Because the sound of you not having something is worse that all the troubles ahead of global warming. Because they convince you it’s too big, too complicated, too expensive, and you want a high standard of living (don’t you). <br />Wake up.

I have heard more sensible rhetoric in videos about the earth being flat and hillary clinton running an undercover nation-wide drug gang. <br />That said, the message is sound and should be heard by everybody; Climate change is a hoax organized by the deep state to lower global toxic emission levels so space aliens can finally come in and harvest our precious bodily fluids. I personally like to fill my tank with double-leaded fuel and take the catalyst off, that will surely keep those pesky aliens and foreign people away from my house.

The Earth <br />at one time in the past was at 19.7 Hz. When the Brain is enveloped by the frequency <br /> of 19.7 Hz. It creates a higher cognitive ability . And flawless DNA reproduction . In contrast - <br />7.8 is a frequency of Anxiety ,Fear, Keeping one in a constant state of &quot; Fight or Flight &quot; <br />Thus the reasoning of the world today . But this frequency is about to change . <br /> The Caretakers { &amp; that&#39;s what I call them - } Designed this part of space - { Specifically } - This soler system - Collecting all the living DNA samples in this galaxy &amp; combining them together in to a water,oxygen,environment { Earth } - Not unlike a Zoo - &amp; putting man in charge As &quot; Caretakers &quot; - <br /> . The monoliths &amp; subterranean caverns Placed around your world are - <br />{ Electromagnetic harmonic resonators } In order to regulate Weather patterns Magnetic fields, &amp; DNA replication - { From the start } Humans where not to have gone in to monoliths- After they did - Their minds became corrupted - <br />{ Thinking they had discovered grate knowledge } They Fell - No longer being the Caretakers of this world - But now wanting to control it The Great Machine { Earth } identified the new vibration of corrupted thinking &amp; the earth shifted 30^ So as to minimize the new influence causing what you call the flood. <br /> { Now to restart } -Or - To correct the frequency application of the function of the monoliths &amp; subterranean caverns - Designed hear from the beginning to regulate frequency - Your planet is being repositioned to it&#39;s original orientation, In relation to your sun . To preserve All life on this planet - <br /> &quot; Blessings &quot; We are the Caretakers We are Not God or gods We where created to spread God&#39;s life seeds What you know as {DNA} throughout the galaxies.. We are the parents of all in this region. <br />The internal frequency of the planet will begin to rise . This Has &amp; will continue - <br />to disrupt - weather events -volcanic events - animals Dye off&#39;s - &amp; - Humans - &amp; - All living systems , on Earth . <br /> No extinction event ! - So Fear Not ! - Move away from large bodies of water. <br />The planet will continue it&#39;s alignment to return to it&#39;s original state . &amp; - Then - <br /> &quot; May their be - Peace On Earth - once more ! &quot; &quot; Blessings &quot;	UCtoTWqqpyZqFnYocCjjA7SQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtoTWqqpyZqFnYocCjjA7SQ	0

I'm not saying I fully understand it but if you simplify things and just say it's about money and power you will never understand why it is successful. It resonates with something deep inside us.

The consesus 4 decades ago was that forrests in Europe would die off never to return within years (Waldsterben). Today, forrests have to be cut so that they don't impeach agriculture land. The consesus in the 90's was that we would die right now from acid rain. But as far as I can see, we have enough life energy to write stupid Youtube comments. If you don't learn from history, you are doomed to repeat it. What is it about in my opinion? Easy. Money and control. You have to instill panic within the population so that they can become open for manipulation. That's how wars are started and that's how people get ripped off. Saddam has WMD's ready within 8 hours works better than Saddam has WMD's ready in 20 years. We will reach the point of no return and are doomed in 12 years works better than there might be a problem in 150 years.

When I was 8 -10 (50+) years ago the story was that we were going to all freeze and the earth would be permanently frozen. While some people believed that BS, most of us were smart enough to know that the seasons change, climate changes occur during seasonal changes. Climate change is the leftist mantra for taking money from taxpayers and attempting to rule by group think mobs. Climate change is a fact of life. If you don’t like the weather, wait a bit, the climate will either warm up or cool down hence, climate change. No scientist worth his salt believes the BS leftist mantra. Mankind does not possess godlike qualities enough to permanently alter the climate. We DO have the ability to interfere with the weather on a temporary basis, but the weather will not be controlled by mankind. It was here before us and continue on with or without us until the end of time unimpeded.

Rapists are innocent and the raped are guilty. Climate change IS happening, and it is being accelerated by man made emissions. Without man, climate would still happen but much slower rate...every 50k years the cycle naturally changes. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, we have accelerated beyond the CO2 levels of the highest peak of any 50k cycle - all within 100 years. THAT is a fact.

Tropical Fossils have actually been found close to the frozen North Pole! The Majority of North America used to be covered in 1.6 KM of ice, what caused that? What caused 1.6 KM of ice to melt? But these variations of our Climate occur NATURALLY, they are not caused by a CO2 variation of 1ppm on a Global Annual Average (Maybe) and CO2 is NOT driving the Climate of the Planet! The Earth is a dynamic, living, breathing organism. If and when the Earth&#39;s Climate becomes constant, like a flat non-varying line, then that will be when the Earth is Dead! Thank God for Climate Change! Thank God for Trump&#39;s influence on Sanity in Climate Leadership! A tax on CO2 does nothing but feed Government, what&#39;s next, a tax on the Sun? Continental Drift? Planetary Orbit Decay? In 2019, in Reality, AGW = Al Gore&#39;s Wrong! The Hockey Stick was Mann-made-up! Keep Calm, emit on! Emit responsibly, as we are regulated to the best of our ability! We need ALL forms of energy, simply used the best one to suit the given need, And remember, we will never get to the effectiveness of the Jetsons, by relying solely on the energies of the Flintstones!

LOL.<br /><br /><br />Mr. Pena doesn&#39;t even have a STEM degree and appears that his career choice is selling get rich quick schemes to rubes.<br /><br />So in that regard channeling global warming denialists seems like a smart business move.

Are you so blind that you believe billions of barrels of liquid energy comes from solid f-cking rock? Are you really that f-cking naïve. Are you stupid enough to think air cleans itself? Where do you think all the pollution goes? Handle it or not but God is completely and total real.

Roughly 97 percent of all peer-reviewed studies on the issue will tell you the same thing: global warming is happening, it presents a serious threat to life on Earth as we know it, and the time to take action is NOW. So bearing this in mind, for any global warming-denying position to have any kind of credibility, one would literally have to establish one or more of the following:<br /><br />(1) That for some reason, leading climatologists around the world don&#39;t currently know how to do their jobs.<br /><br />(2) That, again, for some reason, leading climatologists around the world are currently engaged in some kind of &quot;conspiracy&quot; to spread false information on global warming.<br /><br />(3) That, yet again, for some reason, prominant global warming deniers with no scientific credentials whatsoever (be them big businessmen, politicians, etc.) remain a better source of information on global warming than leading climatologists around the world.<br /><br />I&#39;m all ears.

They all sing from the same hymn book Branden, the same lacking data, the same adjusted data, the same pseudoscience, the same IPCC. The IPCC admits it does not know, you are basing your belief from the section for policy makers summary from AR6. For politicians to use the most exaggerate threat without saying the chances of it happening. The scientists don't know, they don't even know how the climate works. Their so lacking in knowledge they don't even put the sun, clouds or cosmic rays that influence our climate....it's to complicated to add into their models. The models can not hindcast past climates and have no predictive or projective ability, ZERO. Oh and you should know the 97% scientist crap is bogus, it was from John Cook from skeptical science blog a fake scientist and cartoonist. All debunked. And another poll given to a few thousand scientists, only a few hundred responded and out of that they cherry pick 79 and 2 didnt agree ,77 out of 79= 97%	UC_iVdgUEnDaMW8cr-7IE0iw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iVdgUEnDaMW8cr-7IE0iw	1	UgwO_Q3pzaTN-CAsCUR4AaABAg	Brandon Zurvalec

Recycled plastic can be used to fix pod Hope&#39;s in roads. So maybe they&#39;re money in both ways.

Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes. Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the gulf stream still very warm. Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared.<br /><br />Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of herring and smelts which have never before ventured so far north, are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds.<br /><br />I apologize, I neglected to mention that this report was from November 2, 1922.

Be aware of all the data that supports all the arguments, because if he is wrong which there is every possibility that he is,then we are allowing the money and power brokers of this world to dictate again what has got to be truth and what has got to be fake on the strength of there personality and forcefulness in which they deliver a message . There has been so many famous figures in history that have brought the innocent, gullible masses to destruction in nurturing the ego&#39;s of kings and psychopaths all in the name of god or in the name of something else that stinks of lies.

The UN needs these nations and the scamming of the western world ( guilt trip) to destroy us. It is time for Nuclear Power for all electricity and use solar for others we need. But if you ruin fossil fuel the Arabs will have no edge over the world . The waste we produce is far worse .

What’s happening is gases like Carbon dioxide, Methane, Nitrous Oxide etc are being emitted by automobiles, factories, Cows, waste etc at an alarming rate. As populations across the world continue to increase so does demand for transportation, food, water, housing and other resources. Most of the things humans need emit greenhouse gases during their production and housing requires deforestation (trees convert CO2 into oxygen) which doesn’t help the situation. With regard to temperatures just look at the Great Barrier Reef, the polar bears, white rhinos and 80, 000 other animal species which are facing extinction for no reason but human activity. With the leading contributor being climate change. The ozone layer protects people from harmful UV rays which cause skin cancer and is depleted through HCFC’s, CFCs, CO2 and other gas emissions. The ozone layer is depleted over Australia which is why skin cancer is so prevalent here, and yes it is getting hotter in Australia but the ozone is now receding. This is just another American asshole spreading lies to obtain wealth and prosperity, you’re fools for believing this bullshit. 97% of scientist agree that climate change is the result of human activity.

Nevermind the hundreds of millions of years of strata proving the cyclical nature of earth&#39;s climate. A single volcanic eruption puts out more pollution and greenhouse gases than humans do in 100 years. Not to mention cows create more greenhouse gas emissions than cars. There is nothing more futile than trying to prevent nature from taking its course. The earth will forget us long before it dies. And even when we get wiped out because of the folly of man. It will eventually heal itself given enough time. So you might as well live your life now.	UCln0ClgaorePHWg7nI-gPYA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCln0ClgaorePHWg7nI-gPYA	0

Fortunately, a type of button mushroom evolved which could break down wood which ended the last ice age.<br />We&#39;re now pumping out stored CO2 in to the current carbon cycle which is what has been defined as the Holocene era for the last 12,500 years.<br /><br />If you dig up stuff and release it... believe it or not... it adds to current levels.<br /><br />It&#39;s that simple.

Callan, Jr., Princeton University, President of the American Physical Society<br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Curt:<br /><br /><br /><br />When I first joined the American Physical Society sixty-seven years ago it was much smaller, much gentler, and as yet uncorrupted by the money flood (a threat against which Dwight Eisenhower warned a half-century ago).<br /><br /><br /><br />Indeed, the choice of physics as a profession was then a guarantor of a life of poverty and abstinence — it was World War II that changed all that. The prospect of worldly gain drove few physicists. <br /><br /><br /><br />As recently as thirty-five years ago, when I chaired the first APS study of a contentious social/scientific issue, The Reactor Safety Study, though there were zealots aplenty on the outside there was no hint of inordinate pressure on us as physicists. We were therefore able to produce what I believe was and is an honest appraisal of the situation at that time. <br /><br /><br /><br />We were further enabled by the presence of an oversight committee consisting of Pief Panofsky, Vicki Weisskopf, and Hans Bethe, all towering physicists beyond reproach. I was proud of what we did in a charged atmosphere. <br /><br /><br /><br />In the end the oversight committee, in its report to the APS President, noted the complete independence in which we did the job, and predicted that the report would be attacked from both sides. What greater tribute could there be?<br /><br /><br /><br />How different it is now. The giants no longer walk the earth, and the money flood has become the raison d’être of much physics research, the vital sustenance of much more, and it provides the support for untold numbers of professional jobs. <br /><br /><br /><br />For reasons that will soon become clear my former pride at being an APS Fellow all these years has been turned into shame, and I am forced, with no pleasure at all, to offer you my resignation from the Society.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is of course, the global warming scam, with the (literally) trillions of dollars driving it, that has corrupted so many scientists, and has carried APS before it like a rogue wave. It is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist. <br /><br /><br /><br />Anyone who has the faintest doubt that this is so should force himself to read the ClimateGate documents, which lay it bare. (Montford’s book organizes the facts very well.)<br /><br /><br /><br />I don’t believe that any real physicist, nay scientist, can read that stuff without revulsion. I would almost make that revulsion a definition of the word scientist.<br /><br /><br /><br />So what has the APS, as an organization, done in the face of this challenge? It has accepted the corruption as the norm, and gone along with it.<br /><br /><br /><br />For example:<br /><br /><br /><br />1. About a year ago a few of us sent an e-mail on the subject to a fraction of the membership. APS ignored the issues, but the then President immediately launched a hostile investigation of where we got the e-mail addresses.<br /><br /><br /><br />In its better days, APS used to encourage discussion of important issues, and indeed the Constitution cites that as its principal purpose. No more. Everything that has been done in the last year has been designed to silence debate<br /><br /><br /><br />2. The appallingly tendentious APS statement on Climate Change was apparently written in a hurry by a few people over lunch, and is certainly not representative of the talents of APS members as I have long known them. So a few of us petitioned the Council to reconsider it. <br /><br /><br /><br />One of the outstanding marks of (in)distinction in the Statement was the poison word incontrovertible, which describes few items in physics, certainly not this one. In response APS appointed a secret committee that never met, never troubled to speak to any skeptics, yet endorsed the Statement in its entirety. <br /><br /><br /><br />(They did admit that the tone was a bit strong, but amazingly kept the poison word incontrovertible to describe the evidence, a position supported by no one.) <br /><br /><br /><br />In the end, the Council kept the original statement, word for word, but approved a far longer “explanatory” screed, admitting that there were uncertainties, but brushing them aside to give blanket approval to the original. <br /><br /><br /><br />The original Statement, which still stands as the APS position, also contains what I consider pompous and asinine advice to all world governments, as if the APS were master of the universe. It is not, and I am embarrassed that our leaders seem to think it is. <br /><br /><br /><br />This is not fun and games, these are serious matters involving vast fractions of our national substance, and the reputation of the Society as a scientific society is at stake.<br /><br /><br /><br />3. In the interim the ClimateGate scandal broke into the news, and the machinations of the principal alarmists were revealed to the world. It was a fraud on a scale I have never seen, and I lack the words to describe its enormity. Effect on the APS position: none. None at all. This is not science; other forces are at work.<br /><br /><br /><br />4. So a few of us tried to bring science into the act (that is, after all, the alleged and historic purpose of APS), and collected the necessary 200+ signatures to bring to the Council a proposal for a Topical Group on Climate Science, thinking that open discussion of the scientific issues, in the best tradition of physics, would be beneficial to all, and also a contribution to the nation. <br /><br /><br /><br />I might note that it was not easy to collect the signatures, since you denied us the use of the APS membership list. We conformed in every way with the requirements of the APS Constitution, and described in great detail what we had in mind—simply to bring the subject into the open.<br /><br /><br /><br />5. To our amazement, Constitution be damned, you declined to accept our petition, but instead used your own control of the mailing list to run a poll on the members’ interest in a TG on Climate and the Environment. <br /><br /><br /><br />You did ask the members if they would sign a petition to form a TG on your yet-to-be-defined subject, but provided no petition, and got lots of affirmative responses. (If you had asked about sex you would have gotten more expressions of interest.) <br /><br /><br /><br />There was of course no such petition or proposal, and you have now dropped the Environment part, so the whole matter is moot. (Any lawyer will tell you that you cannot collect signatures on a vague petition, and then fill in whatever you like.) <br /><br /><br /><br />The entire purpose of this exercise was to avoid your constitutional responsibility to take our petition to the Council.<br /><br /><br /><br />6. As of now you have formed still another secret and stacked committee to organize your own TG, simply ignoring our lawful petition.<br /><br /><br /><br />APS management has gamed the problem from the beginning, to suppress serious conversation about the merits of the climate change claims. Do you wonder that I have lost confidence in the organization?<br /><br /><br /><br />I do feel the need to add one note, and this is conjecture, since it is always risky to discuss other people’s motives. This scheming at APS HQ is so bizarre that there cannot be a simple explanation for it. <br /><br /><br /><br />Some have held that the physicists of today are not as smart as they used to be, but I don’t think that is an issue. I think it is the money, exactly what Eisenhower warned about a half-century ago. There are indeed trillions of dollars involved, to say nothing of the fame and glory (and frequent trips to exotic islands) that go with being a member of the club. <br /><br /><br /><br />Your own Physics Department (of which you are chairman) would lose millions a year if the global warming bubble burst. When Penn State absolved Mike Mann of wrongdoing, and the University of East Anglia did the same for Phil Jones, they cannot have been unaware of the financial penalty for doing otherwise. <br /><br /><br /><br />As the old saying goes, you don’t have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing. Since I am no philosopher, I’m not going to explore at just which point enlightened self-interest crosses the line into corruption, but a careful reading of the ClimateGate releases makes it clear that this is not an academic question.<br /><br /><br /><br />I want no part of it, so please accept my resignation. APS no longer represents me, but I hope we are still friends.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hal<br /><br /><br /><br />Harold Lewis is Emeritus Professor of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, former Chairman; Former member Defense Science Board, chmn of Technology panel; Chairman DSB study on Nuclear Winter; Former member Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards; Former member, President’s Nuclear Safety Oversight Committee; Chairman APS study on Nuclear Reactor Safety Chairman Risk Assessment Review Group; Co-founder and former Chairman of JASON; Former member USAF Scientific Advisory Board; Served in US Navy in WW II; books: Technological Risk (about, surprise, technological risk) and Why Flip a Coin (about decision making). — via The Telegraph	UCHKb6Q7nRX8yl0ZYcg0ExoA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHKb6Q7nRX8yl0ZYcg0ExoA	0

You take the carbon out of the ground and burn it, and turn it into co2 and cut down all the forests and then what? Change the composition of the air and we will all eventually choke to death? Let alone turn the world into a desert like Mars. It&#39;s a disruption in natural processes. It&#39;s real, a real imbalance. No we may never run out of carbon but we will run out of oxygen because it will be combined 2 parts to one with carbon. And there is a million times more carbon on earth than oxygen. A hundred years from now these people that say its a hoax will look like those that burned witches.	UCxOD0SGuQyH5TYevKghmo7g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxOD0SGuQyH5TYevKghmo7g	0

When, and if ever, I want to know more about what he was specifically referring to, or whether he tells the truth, I will do some research. For now, I am content that he was entertaining.

When anyone makes a number of false claims (focus on the last one it, in part, comes from personal experience and is predominantly false) most people consider the possibility of it being a blatant lie. Or it could be the rantings of someone with a very foggy memory. Are you ambivalent or is Pena's behaviour the norm in a post-truth world?

Maybe there are only 10 others but his suggestion that Robert Swan, Michael Palin and Ranulph Fiennes (been to both poles) haven't "bitched" about climate change is far from factual. Two of these guys have also bitched about his buddy, Trump. It's almost like Pena is saying, "I've talked crap for the last 10min and if you're happy to bend over and take this last story, the jokes on you!"

Dan is off the rails about the pole "bitch", but climate change can be a real "bitch" when world tempertures drop, more extreme weather, shorter growing seasons. We've had a 20 year pause in temperture rise and 10 year break from big events constantly, they will come in every year like they did in the 60's 70's.

Government always try to come up with something to scare people so they can have more control over them. If governments in the west really believe what they said, they would be going to war with China and India which by themselves are responsible for over 50 percent of CO2 emissions on Earth.

The hoaxsters are doing nothing for the environment. They are just lining their pockets like all doomers do. The profession of scaring people with doomsday scenarios predates history.

You can tey telling the victims of the CA wildfires last year and see their response, you can tell the villages in the South Pacific islands whose homes are under water due to rising sea levels. You can tell the people of Pueeto Rico who lost over 8000 people due to Global Warming! Go ask the people of N Carolina, Georgia and S Carolina who lost their homes due to global warming!

Next lifetime you may want to plan by studying in school and educating yourself, so you don't turn out to be such a nutcase in your next life.

Democrats and Liberals are always HAPPY to educate you morons, so don't feel bad, just try to learn and one day you'll become a Patriot to your Country. Part of being an American though, is to REJECT the fascist nature of Trump/Putin and to be ready to CALL OUT his incredible bigotry, racism and hatred for all Americans. Trump has done nothing but attack other Americans and the FBI and Law Enforcement who are coming after him and his CRIMES against the USA. Trump is already an un-indicted Co-conspirator in DEFRAUDING the American People about his hush money payments. That is an impeachable offense alone, and Trump has had DOZENS of impeachable offenses during his 2 year attack on the USA. We need to get him in prison where he can be raped by BUBBA, which will teach him an important lesson about putting his NATION ahead of his own interests, which Trump refused to do while he was president. He's no longer president, he's a TRAITOR SCUM BAG and should be hung by the balls and set on fire.

You can tell he is in a state of defence as when it comes to the part of the sentence where he has to provide the empirical evidence to support his stance , he mumbles, waves his hands in a dismissive gesture and actually comes out with nothing at all. I don&#39;t know about this guy, nor would i want to. So, if you believe this then first read the scientific empirical data that proves it is happening, humans are destructive by nature. then place your denial theories against them with empirical data. not economic data. show us scientific data from tests that global warming is not happening. Look towards our oceans, yes they are ours, humans as the highest functioning and evolved species on this planet have a responsibility to be the rightful guardians of this planet. If you don&#39;t subscribe to this then that makes you a virus, you consume until your host dies. simple steps really recycle, be responsible, be aware.

Even before this fake climate agreement the U.S. had already done more to reduce C02is emissions than any country in the world with a large population! You need to remember that one of the biggest lies in this man made climate change is that C02is is pollution, it's not pollution it's literally what life on earth is made from and plants start dieing at 150 ppm at the turn of the century 1900 , the co2 count was 180 ppm so literally the fact that fossil fuels we used saved life as we know it ! Satellite Vedio has shown our world getting greener and healthier as a result of man putting C02is back into the atmosphere!now as far as the deadly pollution in both china and India they don't have regulations on fuel refineries like America does it's for this reason that when obama shut down by over regulating the fossil fuel industry it meant that countries producing oil to sell could sell fossil fuels that use the worst refining process! Second and most important and you will not hear this come up in any of the anti C02 talks about reducing our carbon footprint is that to meet the requirements that were literally picked out of thin air was that humans in America exhale more co2 than the limit set for us , so even if for arguments sake we completely did away with all use of fossil fuels we would need to kill one third of the American population just to meet their rediculous limit ! America produces the cleanest refined fossil fuels in the world already! But no one talks about what would happen to our economy and the massive nationwide deaths that would happen ! Mass starvation, mass death from freezing to death , there would not be enough money to give out entitlements that the democrats use to buy votes , you wouldn't have to worry about what kind of world we are leaving our children because after the ww3 that would take place from fighting for resources there wouldn't be any future to leave ! All this based on lies about man made climate change ! The climate is always changing and we have lived through both warming and cooling but remember there's been far more loss of life because of global cooling than all the times our climate warmed up !

The reason why these man made climate change: sceinctist; refuse to hand over their data to be checked by those who decent is because they have been adjusting their data to fit their claims ! It's the way sceince works! When congress ask the head of the EPA to hand over the data and the names of the sceinctist who were makings these claims that the EPA was making policies on she refused claiming that if they turned over the data then that data will be challenged by other sceinctist. Well of course it would be challenged that's how sceince works and if America is going to make trillion dollar policies then by god that sceince needs to be open so it can be challenged!

Unfortunately, his north pole south pole story was far from fact and, when you watch it through again, theatrical dishonesty comes to mind. Robert Swan, Michael Palin and Ranulph Fiennes have each been to both poles and each have "bitched" plenty about climate change. A couple of them have also bitched about Trump. 3 out of 10 is significantly higher than 0 (love the way he formed a zero with his finger and thumb for emphasis). My money would be on a few of the others having done a bit of bitching as well. Let's not worry about the others too much. Wouldn't want to embarrass Honest Dan any more than necessary!

Providing no information to pull a trigger with. Rather defensive off da back foot telling irrelevant stories and deflecting questions. Accelerated warming ? hmmm isnt the jury still out! I mean Hasnt the global temperature been going up every year for the last how many years? Dans reaction to the questions is enough to overheat even the most patient pacifist and thus he and people like him are directly causing and contributing to global warming anomoly yet again.<br />But who cares right? Typical attitude of the west. I heard the expression doent exist in the east! Is that right? <br />Anyway, if the sea rise picks up momentum, it wont stop for a while. So since Dan the Man says global warming might happen naturally anyway, shouldnt we be more careful in case we bring it on, accelarate it or risk , or to put it in plain english.. Shouldnt we be more thoughtful, or ultimately.. human.	UC--lDrQ-y3xQGgdvxN477wQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC--lDrQ-y3xQGgdvxN477wQ	0

Also that we keep thinking they're genuinely concerned with "climate" and not see right in front of us that humans produce the what they've deemed poisonous every time we exhale. CO2 is not what they want to eliminate, it's just a clinical sterile way talk about depopulation in the open and get useful idiots to fight over who gets to be the first virtuous sacrifice.

I think you are mistaking confirmation bias for facts. As I said earlier, there have been people like you throughout history who have attempted to discredit the scientific community for whatever reason be it for religious or monetary reasons. In a century's time, people like you will be seen as quaint and primitive just as we now view people who believed int he geocentric model. But let's just put climate change aside for a moment and look at the bigger picture here: Are you even aware of what you are advocating for? Fuel that demonstrably reduces air quality, irresponsible waste disposal by factories that pollute our waters and lead to sickness and disease, reliance on outdated energy sources like coal which even coal mine owners say has no future... Is this really the hill you want to die on? As I said earlier, green energy is projected to be a multi-trillion dollar industry, and its already creating a lot of jobs, in spite of the Trump Administration's best attempts to stifle its progress and spreading falsehoods like "windmills cause cancer" or how electrical grids augmented by windmills will cease to function when there is no wind. It's funny, Republicans never seem to be against any other emerging industry, yet they are adamant about opposing an industry that happens to conflict with the interests of one of their largest donors. Rather convenient, don't you think? And they've been all desperately trying to spread lies to stifle green energy, "Wind turbines kill birds!" Not true, wind turbines account for 0.1% of all annual bird deaths. "Wind farms are an eyesore." Funny, Republicans never seemed to mind that when it comes to building massive nuclear power plants or fracking stations. "Solar farms don't work during the winter!" If I need to explain to you why this one is utterly retarded, then I must question why I am even bothering talk to you. You conservatives are always talking about the invisible hand of the free market, well the free market is currently overwhelmingly in favor green energy. It has already employed 4.2 million people across Europe with a turnover rate of 700 billion Euros. It's been so successful that nuclear power plants have been getting decommissioned across Europe. You can deny the existence of climate change all you want, but you can't deny how profitable green energy is and will continue to be and in the end you are betting on fuel sources that have been around for over a century and will not be sustainable for another century.

People have been doubting science throughout history, and they are _always_ proven wrong with time and laughed at by later generations. What makes you think you will be any different? Do you even know how the scientific method works? Do you have any idea how hard it is to get your research through the peer review system? I'm guessing no, because you're a typical lizard-brained moron who thinks "Hur hur, it's cold out so global warming is fake!" Meanwhile we have millions of refugees in Bangladesh that have been displaced by rising sea levels, the Great Barrier Reef has been bleached and is now dying, entire species of animals are dying off at a rate that was previously unheard of, and the five hottest years on record have been the last five years. And a was if that wasn't enough proof, a Harvard study found undeniable proof that big oil has known about the effects of climate change since the 1940's and kept their findings hidden. It boggles the mind how anyone can think that every single scientist in the world is somehow in on this big conspiracy that would in no way benefit them while ignoring the fact that it's clearly big oil that would have the most to lose it we adopte more environmentally friendly sources of energy. Not to mention that the anti-climate change crowd has been caught lying over and over again. They constantly cherry-picked data out of context to prove their point while using discredited scientists on the payroll of bug oil to try and discredit findings by the scientific community. Then there's Patrick Moore, the climate change denier who is constanly presented as the "co-founder of Greenpeace," when in reality he was nothing more than an activist that worked with them back in the early days. The fact that you people have to lie so much to push your agenda only serves to prove that you are on the wrong side. And to top it all off, green energy is projected to be a multi-trillion dollar industry. Solar energy is one of the fastest growing industries in America and it currently employs more people in the state of California alone than coal mining does for the entire country. The free market says that green energy is the way to go, but people like you want to get in the way of it over some petty insistence that this is all a Chinese hoax. You are both delusional and willfully ignorant.	UCVjjlMquPM-ClvjfPUG3RGA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVjjlMquPM-ClvjfPUG3RGA	1	UgzgP3ecDvMjsSjszTl4AaABAg	Atari Dad

I&#39;m just looking forward to seeing if they agree on the shape of the earth or the truth about climate change first. Merica is really becoming a meme in the rest of the world. I honestly don&#39;t know who is the most jokingly misinformed people in the world, North Korea or Merica, but I think I would point towards Merica in the post-Trump times.<br /><br />I love these comment-sections, they&#39;re pure comedy gold!

Right now I am at a rented condo along the Pacific Ocean in Mexico for a few weeks. Likely in 20 years when it becomes absolutely obvious to all that the oceans are rising and that these types of properties will be difficult to sell when you know the ocean will be at the door in another 30 years it will be damn near impossible to sell these units. They will be used until no longer possible, but next to no one will be buying these units at a price even close to the prices they are selling for now. This will be true for all real estate within 10 feet (3 metres) around the world including Mar a Logo.	UCIwv7g-1NpVx_lC066g2zQA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIwv7g-1NpVx_lC066g2zQA	0

It's been "climate change" for the past decade or so. Also, it was predicted by numerous scientists that there would be no more snow or winters by this time. Instead, we just saw polar vortex's with -20 and -30 degree weather this past winter.

For me it's an observable fact. I used to fly rc planes in the 80's and had a ball. Decided to take it up again last year and had to give it up because it was too damned hot outside! You don't hear about the ozone layer any more because the cause was eliminated by banning cfc's in spray cans and air conditioners. We had to start referring to global warming as global climate change because every time some damned idiot saw a snowflake, they claimed this disproved global warming. It's causing a few areas to be colder at times, but in the end it's causing the average global temperature to rise, probably the reason the last 18 out of 19 years we've had record high temperatures. You're probably like a lot of other people, "I've made up my mind, don't confuse me with the facts!", but here's the thing. You're most likely to live long enough to definitely find out whether or not it's real. You have my sympathy.

If you compare the ice sheets on arctic areas you can see how much we've warmed. Fuck Williams, all you have to do is compare modern photos of mountain tops from 20 years ago and compare them to today. Global WARMING IS REAL and it's happening RIGHT NOW! Remember those wildfires in CA that killed so many people? Global Warming? The homes flooding on coastal areas worse than EVER in our history in the worst hurricane season in human history and you've got your head so far up your ass you don't think there's global warming?

First, you seemed to conflate the hole in the ozone layer with anthropogenic climate change and apparently didn't understand why that's not making headlines anymore. And btw, I was an adolescent in the 80s and don't remember being told we were going to die from the hole in the ozone layer. Who, exactly, was telling you that?! Secondly, you didn't seem to realize that the term "anthropogenic climate change" has been used since the 1950's and not changed to from "global warming". Third, your assertion that it's "bullshit" is a display of your ignorance of the published peer reviewed science. You weren't just "remembering what the scientific community was scaring us with decade by decade", you were arguing from ignorance and incredulity. "Tell somebody in 2019 that they need to be worried about the greenhouse effect and see what they say"? Well, that's a non sequitur since it doesn't logically follow that people's opinions are a determining factor of the reality of anthropogenic climate change; it's the evidence derived from the science that is important. There's an overwhelming preponderance of evidence if you care to read up on it. Literally thousands of scientists across the globe have been studying this for a century; that's why I suggested educating yourself. Have a good day.

I'm more interested in how an average citizen(Are you a scientist or have you any experience of studies in science related endeavours?) comes to the conclusion a particular piece of science in false and often with an intriguing degree of certainty. Evolution, vaccine safety, cancer cures, etc often come under the same type of scrutiny and often involving conspiracy theories. Do people who doubt the science believe the data has been faked? How is it that the scientists from other fields of study have been fooled in to believing the fake data? Or are the other scientists in on the conspiracy to fool the public(for no apparent benefits and at the risk of their professional reputation. Tens of thousands of scientists who, for the most part present themselves as competent decent members of society). Could the data that might support a climate change hoax be just as susceptible to "faking"? Isn't the idea that the scientists are in on a conspiracy or that they are being fooled by the climate science specialists, "just a theory" as well?

So, are you claiming that it's not really peer reviewed, yet the scientific community is falsely saying that it is?! Is that what I'm supposed to take away from that part of the statement?! And then there's the part that insists that it's "junk science". What does that even mean?! Are you implying that it's pseudoscientific, where it is conducted by unqualified people or that the methodology used is flawed, or even that the data and/or observations are corrupted?! Could you possibly speak more vaguely?! I seriously doubt it!! Wow, you sound just like my elderly father who has done absolutely no research into the actual science that's been done globally for decades, but has the hypocrisy to do an armchair evaluation and conclude that it's "all bullshit!". I know it's easier to make these idiotic blanket statements like "the climate's always changing" and "it's junk science", but here in reality, where I live, you need evidence to support your assertions. I mean, if you're ignorant of the scientific evidence, that's fine(everyone is ignorant of certain information); but please stop spreading your ignorance to others. There's an overabundance of that phenomenon! And then there's your argument from incredulity about homes losing their value "if the ocean was creeping up to their door". First, this seems to be another display of your ignorance pertaining to ocean levels rising in that it's not a even rise throughout the earth. Thermal expansion, winds and currents, and gravitational differences on the earth are all factors to the amount of rise in any given location. I don't know what maps at what distance in the past or at what elevation you're even talking about, but if you don't think ocean levels are rising and will accelerate, I would suggest you speak with the mayor of Miami or maybe Norfolk about this. Either could tell you about the precautions and proposals for funding appropriations to try to protect their cities. Coastal streets in Miami are already flooding at high tide that hadn't done so before and new construction in certain areas are elevating buildings by approximately three feet in preparation for the rising waters. So go ahead and live in your ignorant bubble where these things aren't happening; meanwhile, I'll be living in reality where these things are actually occurring. What always amazes me the most is how nearly all of the population has internet access and can look up and read the best evidence possible about any given subject, yet many listen to the least qualified and draw conclusions from that. It's analogous to asking your auto mechanic to perform your heart surgery. Would you do that? I know I wouldn't!

Btw, in order for anthropogenic climate change to be a hoax, thousands of scientists throughout the world for the last seventy years would have been taking part. Sure, that's real plausible; it's been a global effort falsifying observations and data and having it peer reviewed since the 1950's. Are you joking?! But wait, you said the climate's been changing throughout the earth's history. No s#$t, it has; that's like saying that water is wet! That's why there is natural climate change and anthropogenic climate change. For you to make your claims, it demonstrates an ignorance of the science. The CO2 levels have risen and fallen naturally in the past through natural processes (flood basalt events, limestone weathering, etc.). The CO2 rise the earth is experiencing now has an anthropogenic signature in the form of C13 isotopic evidence. There is so much evidence showing that anthropogenic climate change is a reality.

Yeah, the ozone problem has been essentially solved; maybe, just maybe, that's why you don't hear about it anymore! Also, look up some of the first published research about "global warming" from the 1950's; if you do, you'll see that they call it anthropogenic climate change as they do today! Scientists haven't changed their terminology. The term "global warming" gets used in the media and only reflects one aspect of anthropogenic climate change. As much as you don't want to believe it, the narrative hasn't shifted and it's not bullshit! Please get an education instead of spreading ignorance! Have a good day.

Those things are not even related, and if youre referring to the "Global cooling" hypothesis of the 1960s only a small minority of scientists ever believed that, it wasnt common knowledge, nothing has changed, especially your blatant disregard for scientific fact.

No, your ignoring an obvious fact that is proved by science. Even if u do not believe in climate change, watch the movie Before the Flood. After you’ve seen that movie then decide your opinion. But at least go in open minded and be willing to listen a bit. If u still don’t agree with science after that then god help us all cuz our children and grandchildren’s lives are gonna be hell. Although, depending on your age, most of these things including sea rise, death of coral reefs, mass drought, ect, will happen in your lifetime too. Climate change isn’t something in the future.

I have a slightly different view after diving deep into climate change denial. So I think that climate change is 100% happening and is undeniable since its observable. The main 2 questions are 1. Are humans causing it, and 2. Can government fix it. While I'm no scientist myself and am not gonna pretend to have the slightest idea of the science behind it, I choose to believe that humans are causing it. (At the moment I just think there is a bit more evidence for that side). However, I now changed my mind a bit of the second question, I dont think government is the only solution and if we just give them power and our money they can solve all our problems. I think government has a role to play in it, but def not the sole role, and the problem will have to be solved by investment in new technology.

For once i wished people would look into the evidence found by SCIENTISTS instead of youtubers and politicians! The sea level rises roughly 2 millimeters per year. So in the last century sea levels rose 20 centimeters. And in 2120 it will be most likely 50 centimeters. And that is a lot of water.

Well if that was the case, all the heat could escape out the 2 giant holes..Also these "experts" said back in the 1970's that all the worlds oil would be gone by now...Don't believe everything you hear on CNN.... Also Bill Nye "The Science Guy" isn't even an actual scientist...He's an actor who only plays the role of a nerdy scientist on PBS TV shows...CNN calls him an actual scientist because they know their stupid gullible audience will believe everything they say....With 7 billion people on the planet I think we should be more worried about other forms of toxic pollution, deforestation,plastics in the oceans ruining oceanic ecosystems and loss of natural resources...Not C02 gas that we exhale when we breath as a top priority. Notice they want to tax C02 but will allow you to emit it as long as you pay a tax? They don't say, "hey you can dump mercury & lead as long as you pay your mercury & lead dumping tax". Also they could right now very easily convert all cars on the road to propane which burns way cleaner than gas and emits less C02 & other toxic gasses. But when volcanoes erupt they emit huge amounts of C02 and toxic gasses so how are we gonna stop global warming/cooling from volcanic eruptions? Volcanic eruptions have been proven to drastically change weather patterns and spew as much C02 as millions of cars on the road.

I assume you expect me to speculate as to why funding might have been withheld. Money for research is not unlimited and, with the little knowledge of how funding decisions are made, I would assume some sort of cost/benefit analysis would be done(amongst many other analyses). Someone asking for a million dollars to disprove the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer could query the funding decision in much the same way you have. If someone proposed a study that would disprove the link between smoking and lung cancer, we could probably point to an error in the methodology. Did you really expect me to say there is a massive conspiracy by the vast majority of scientists to hide the truth? And finally, one thing that has been quietly bugging me throughout my response, if funding was cut, how were these studies completed to result in them disproving global warming(I presume you mean of the anthropogenic kind)? Or who provided the money to complete the studies that disproved global warming?	UCkqiSX4O4C-SWYU-LzEofBQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqiSX4O4C-SWYU-LzEofBQ	1	Ugww1tFiTljJNNcyUM54AaABAg	Him Bike

And other words nothing. There's nothing we can do about the climate changing because it has happened before and it will happen again. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try and have clean air and water. But let's be realistic we are not the cause for global warming. Which is funny because now it's climate change before it was the ozone layer then it was we're all going to die from the cold because we're going to go into an Ice Age then it was dust bowls are going to come because of the drought because of the Heat and now it's just climate change. And then you guys all go Nazi when tornado season comes around like this is unprecedented actually you're right it is unprecedented these are the weakest tornadoes in 20-30 years. Nothing supports the concept that humans are the cause of global warming absolutely positively nothing and that's why I actual climate scientist have said that there is not conclusive evidence that humans are the cause of it.

Science is in the field of observation Science is in the field of sense. Love is not science Love is in the will As Pascal said “The heart has reasons that reason cannot know.” God is Love. Therefore God is above science. One of my biggest pet peeves is when famous scientist try to speak on God. They have no degree in Theology They have no expertise They have NOTHING to tell me about God Yet, today its all the rage for famous scientist to speak on God. Formula ? e = mc(squared) Smoking formula ? They have pics of black lungs of smokers And pink lungs of non smokers. Why don’t I care if evolution is true or not ? Because I’m not in charge of the universe. God can make evolution true or God can make the universe without it. I just think it’s funny how people think all creation just happened by chance. Darwin thought the human cell was simple. Darwin was wrong. The more people study science the less likely they are to be religious. Anthony Flew I think his name is just became a believer from seeing DNA. Leah Libresco is a physicist and leading atheist blogger who recently became Catholic. Jesus said “Father thank you for showing these things to the simple and hiding them from the wise.” Einstein said the more I study science the more I believe in God. Sir Isaac Newton said Atheism is senseless Sir Isaac Newton wrote more books on God than science There are many scientists who believe in God, but I don’t think big media is going to put them on tv. The media hates God more than the scientific evidence. Yes I’ve heard the idea that “Study poor vs. rich societies and you will see the poor believe in God and the rich don’t for the most part” I came from a very poor very religious family. We weren’t perfect by no stretch. As I said my brother OD on heroin. Problem is, he had stopped going to church and was a millionaire. I remember getting kicked out of public school and going to catholic school when I was 13. Catholic school kids were super rich and I was super poor. One day at lunch we were all gathered around and my rich friend jimmy said “come to my house Friday nite and we can get drunk?” I told him my mom would kill me. I didn’t go. I still don’t drink. Anyways about 30yrs later I saw a guy I recognized as jimmys friend. I asked him how is jimmy doing? He gave me a very strange look and said Jimmy is a homeless druggie. I almost cried. But yes I’m familiar with the theory that rich societies don’t believe. Maybe we weren’t made to be rich. The guy that founded DOMINOs pizza Is a Catholic. Tom Montague. He is a billionaire. He has said publicly his goal is to give it all away !!! Your right my 99% thing is a guess with no evidence. But it makes me think Why are all these rich Hollywood types committing suicide and not going to church ?

I will give you a few bits that I suggest you pursue a little further. 1. Jury, judge, evidence......guilt......jail...? 2. Never tried producing a formula for evolution. Can you please give me examples, such as the formula to prove the love between a husband and wife OR how about a formula to prove god? Or maybe the formula proving smoking increases the chance of lung cancer?...... Why don't you care if evolution is true or not? To the degree that the small amount of evidence I have allows, I believe it is quite likely you do..... The more people study science and the more they understand life and the universe, the less religious they are likely to be and the more likely they are to disbelieve("hate" is not an accurate word to use in this situation) in the existence of a god/s. Why do you think this is suspicious? Do those young, relatively academic university students who choose to study chemistry, physics, biology, etc have a greater likelihood of not believing in God OR does an understanding of science etc.....its easy from here.....be bold and adventurous please.... I think I agree....beliefs in themselves are not as much of a problem as the actions that are influenced by beliefs. The actions AS A RESULT OF A DISBELIEF IN GOD/S vs the actions as a result of the belief in a god/s - the evidence doesn't help with this line of argument. Research the relationship between human prosperity, happiness and societal dysfunction in relationship to the religiosity of its people. Between current nations/cultures/etc and also throughout history the EVIDENCE is interesting. Your 99% ...church goers etc stuff is a "guess" clearly not based on the evidence. Too late, you've already been told there is a mountain evidence, and there IS a mountain of evidence. Conspiracy and ill informed suspicion require evidence as well.

Math is the great equalizer. I agree with you Mountains of evidence can help scientists Like tons of practice can help athletes. But during a game the athlete can’t say “I practiced a lot, so therefore I win.” You can use mountains of evidence all you want, but mountains of evidence can’t be your answer? If mountains of evidence is your answer you fail. Tell me the formula that proves evolution Don’t tell me there is mountains of evidence that proves evolution. I don’t care if evolution is true or not I have no dog in this fight But I find it suspicious that those who push evolution hate God to a large degree. Being an atheist is not a problem The actions of atheists is a problem. It’s s distinction that makes a difference. My mom and dad had no education. They had no money. They had 8 kids. And yet they were smart as a whip. Then we have super smart educated people doing all kinds of crap. I can’t count how many tv shows I’ve seen of millionaires killing their wives and kids.

My point was that evolution is nothing like a Lamborghini just falling together. Similarly, I don't know of anyone who would think god has boxes of animal parts that he just glues together. That's my point. If I used the word "ruled" regarding the Catholic Church and evolution I can see how that might have been confusing. "Ad populum is a false argument" is a straw man argument. The principle of charity is these exchanges will help. You have trouble understanding evolution because you haven't looked at much of the evidence and you have probably had trouble understanding it. To compare evidence for flat earth and young earth is ridiculous. Why would you say that to someone who has even a basic understanding? Again, cells falling together to form the first life is not evolution but science can certainly try to answer this. God of the gaps arguments are unfortunate. One thing we do understand(denying this is difficult) is that even if the probability of chemicals combining to start life is a one in a trillion chance, we have billions of years, roughly a billion trillion stars and a rough estimate of 30 billion planets in our galaxy alone. Probability confuses your average gambler but this first life thing is not such a problem. We both know you have not looked at much evidence at all. Radiometric dating, tectonic plate movement, DNA evidence, vestigial organs etc . You might be having trouble believing it simply because you haven't taken the time to read about it. With your limited knowledge you will never be particularly sure of anything. There are mountains of evidence or at least plenty of hills of very strong compelling evidence. If not evolution then god has done his best to make it look like evolution.	UCkqiSX4O4C-SWYU-LzEofBQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqiSX4O4C-SWYU-LzEofBQ	1	Ugww1tFiTljJNNcyUM54AaABAg	Him Bike

Well done! The Lamborghini v hummingbird analogy is similar to the watchmaker analogy from a couple of hundred years ago and the 747 from a junkyard of scrap metal analogy. Analogies don't always work well if a key element is significantly different. The fact the bird is the result of two birds sharing their genetic information to produce offspring is a significant difference. I guess you don't think each animal is handcrafted by god. What I mean is obviously to talk blue eyed Scandinavians would not produce a short child with brown eyes and dark skin. They might have a relatively short child. Just like two average people can have relatively tall child. Can two giraffe have one offspring with a significantly short neck and another with a very long neck? Which one would be more likely to reach the juicy leaves and therefore survive to pass on their genes? I presume you didn't come up with the Lamborghini v hummingbird analogy yourself. There are a number of similar questions that have all been answered but continue to be repeated. Others include: if we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys? Scientists have no transitional fossils between ape and man or any other species for that matter? Carbon dating doesn't work? It will take some work on your behalf but finding out why evolution is true will be an experience that will make your bike ride across Australia look like a walk down the street(Sorry, your ride across Australia was exceptionally impressive). The biology departments of all the world's leading universities, all the major scientific organisations and even the Catholic Church have been through the mountains of evidence and concluded that the process of evolution is responsible for the diversity of life on Earth. Darwin came up with the idea over 150 years ago without the benefits of radiometric dating or our knowledge of DNA or our understanding of how the continent's have been slowly moving over millions of years. All the information gathered by chemists, geologists and biologists fit perfectly. I can lead you to some interesting facts. The number of chromosomes between apes and humans was given as evidence against evolution until technology showed the joining of two(Google and read more please). The laryngeal nerve origins. Mammals of Australia(laying eggs!) Snake pelvis, spurs and leg genes. Birds and teeth genes. Vitamin c genes in humans. It is not a massive well crafted conspiracy. 2 - 3% Neanderthal genes in many of us!

I sincerely appreciate your comment that you are not attacking me and I feel the same when it comes to exchanges like the one we are having. We are probably very different in many ways I sense a mutual honest interest to understand each other. The YouTube comment section is not the best place for amicable conversation but I'm happy to operate under the principle of charity and learn a little more. Every(maybe 99.8%) biologist would agree, none of those things happen by chance. People made the car and evolution accounts for the others without being concerned with "chance". "What are the chances of the first life starting?" Seems like a reasonable question and there a few ways to look at it that might help. Someone picks all the winning numbers in a lottery. They win $100mill. It was a 1 in 20 million chance that they would win. The person who won feels extraordinarily special but mathematics and probability account for this without a problem. Like the infinite monkeys typing theorem. Life on our planet is similar to the lotto winner, because it happened to us/Earth it feels a little weird. As before, I suggest you Google chance and evolution to find a much better explanation. As much as it is always good to be ready to change your beliefs in light of new evidence, we will probably both remain unchanged . At least we will maybe have a better insight in to a different point of view. I'm a 45 yr old father of three, maths/science secondary teacher(my profession is probably not particularly surprising), I was once a fulltime swimming coach, born and live in Perth, Australia and lived in the UK for 3 years. I believe the existence of a god to be very unlikely. I believe the existence of a Christian/ Muslim/Etc god to be even more unlikely. I enjoy reading science stuff and I enjoy listening to a number of different science podcasts on the way to work. I respect your privacy so no need to tell me details of yourself. Cheers!

It is a key element of biology. Evolution explains how life started as much as physics explains how the stock market works. Life, or maybe some sort of self replicating organic molecule, might have formed yesterday but would likely have been quickly gobbled up by bacteria. You really need to go to your local universities biology department. Could life not have started several times before. All of which lasted for 12 seconds, or 5 days, or 10 years, or 1 million years??? Life might have started yesterday in my backyard. Like I also said, the "by chance" thing is kind of irrelevant too. There is plenty out there explaining why. Why bring Christianity in to this discussion? It is irrelevant? I find some of the reasoning a little confusing. For example, if we find that life has likely started numerous times on Earth, what conclusions should we come to regarding the Christian god? If there is a God, why not more than once? These questions are quite new to me! I would love to answer a few more questions about evolution. Some that still persist are: if we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys? Why no transitional fossils and why no missing links? Carbon dating doesn't work or is way too inaccurate. I can help but it would be better if you could read some books on it. Why Evolution Is True (Jerry Coyne) is a great book to read. I understand, to at least some degree, why Christians often push back. And it certainly can result in a loss of faith. 99.9% of biologists believe it. It is in school text books alongside gravity, etc. If it is fake then all the more reason to understand it.

It might be that you don't understand the theory of evolution or the misunderstanding might be on my behalf. It might be dependent on the answer to your last question. We don't know for sure that life only started once. As with most good questions these days, plenty of relatively clever people have already asked the very same question. A few seconds on Google came up with an article in New Scientist about this topic a couple of years ago, as well as plenty of others. I hope you read some of them and enjoy them in the same spirit in which they were probably written.

Should I say science has nothing to do with Patrick Moore? I guess you might have been trying to suggest my comment relied on the logical fallacy of appeal to popularity. It didn't. I could have been tempted to accuse you of appeal to authority but I do think the principle of charity is important in such exchanges......I'm not sure what your cult reference was about.....Now for a serious question (I think I may have been a bit facicious, my apologies). What should an average person, with nothing more than a high school science education, do? If someone woke from a 30 year coma and simply asked a few random PhD Scientists(be they chemists, physicists, biologists, etc) from several universities they would hear, from the vast majority, that manmade climate change is no hoax. I hope you would agree, for such a hypothetical person to believe in climate change would be quite reasonable. What would you do to convince this person otherwise? Could this person do enough research over a week or two to confidently negate the experience and education of several dozen PhD Scientists? (Remember, we both agree scientific truth stands independent of "most scientists").

At least to explore the possibilities. There can be many arguments against global warming, but it is very clear that deniers are in favor of maintaining their oil businesses. Yes there is still alot of oil. But what&#39;s the harm in discovering new technologies. In the end, regardless of whether our government supports climate change or goes against it, its us common folk that are going to get ass raped.

You would realize how fast things are changing there. Do you realize how important glaciers are for ocean currents? Do you realize how important ocean currents are for marine life (much of the worlds food comes from there). Do you realize how important ocean currents are for weather patterns? Do you realize how important weather patterns are for farming, and inland ecological systems? Do you realize the importance of food and clean air? Now does it make sense why climate change is such a big deal and how things are conected? Perhaps it&#39;s not a big deal for you in your lifetime but if you have children, nieces, nephews or grandchildren do you want them to think of you as just another part of the lazy selfish generation that caused their sufferings? All because you didn&#39;t want to turn on the tv or computer and be told to make the right changes so they have a better life. This isn&#39;t supposed to be about just you it&#39;s supposed to be what&#39;s best for them. Trust me, I&#39;m fighting for a good cause and it feels great!

Ugwd3layo08FXPHtU7t4AaABAg	0	0	2019-01-26 10:15:36	Steve derp	He’s got a similar opinion to what I have. But I think I can articulate it a bit better. Basically global warming is a reality of leaving an ice age. We left the ice age only about 10,000 years ago. During the time or Christ and the Height of the Roman Empire the temperature was higher than it was today. The warming we’re seeing today is largely since 1850. Between 1500-1820 there was a period known as the “little ice age” where across the globe the temperatures fell and as a result crops yields were smaller, rivers and lakes stayed frozen for longer and in general the climate of the globe was colder. Around the civil war natural warming started because no major fossil fuel usage started until well after the warming ended the little ice age. We know it was colder during this time because of paintings, journals, older temperature data as well as core samples and even things like furniture and instruments from that period show wood that grew in colder climates because the rings on the trees were far smaller than usual. I think that the reality is that the warming we are seeing is about 95% natural. I think that the amount we are contributing is so small that even if we had never burned fossil fuels the warming would have still happened but at a slightly slower rate. The harsh reality is that even if global warming were true and that we were the only cause of it because of emissions from burning fossil fuels. The reality is that it is absolutely too late. We have already burned well over half of the worlds reserves of oil. Now we still will have plenty of oil for the next 200 years as global reserves as well as future reserves in the arctic, oil sands in Alberta and oil shale in America is literally about 5 trillion barrels of oil. But we have probably burned off the other half already at this point. So the reality is that even if we all stopped today. It would make no difference. If there scientific theory is actually right, stopping today will not stop global warming. In fact stopping now will only make the problem worse because the majority of emissions in the future are going to be directly from our agricultural impact in the form of growing food and animals which coupled with a population of 10 billion will make it so that we will absolutely be creating just as many emissions from our food, garbage and sewage as the entire worlds population burning fossil fuels did just 50 years ago. But the real kicker is this. While America and Europe have had cars, air conditioning, electricity and all of the other convenience of modern life that we have enjoyed for nearly 100 years. The rest of the world. Asia, South America, India, Africa and the Middle East are just now getting these cars, air conditioning, and electricity. While we might be willing to stop having these things these other people will not take that route and the countries that own oil in OPEC are never going to stop selling that oil. So even if America and Europe stop using that oil the rest of the world will continue drilling, selling and burning that fuel. So in my opinion the hard pill to swallow is that the only thing to do is to forge ahead and develop green technology and wait for the tech to catch up with the ambitions the same way we did with video games, computers and smartphones. But in the mean time we can use our fossil fuels to eventually build a green economy but there is absolutely no point in trying to force that market shift. The United Nations and liberal parties of every country seem to not be able to accept these facts. My main reason that I don’t believe there rhetoric about global warming is that they never offer any solution on how to scrub the atmosphere of CO2 either through growing new Forrest’s or physically capturing it in the atmosphere. There only plan is to tax fuel, tax electricity and tax energy companies. It’s obvious to anyone who is paying attention that they don’t intend on actually doing anything they just want the tax revenue to give to their voters and fund their social programs. They don’t actually want to fix the problem, they want to tax the thing they don’t like in order to pay for the programs they do like. Its very much so like a religion for leftists. Carbon and any form of emissions or pollution is considered a “sin” the taxes you pay on those are the same as indulgences the Catholic Church used to sell in the dark ages. And in the same way that the church used that money to pay for churches and justified exploiting the poor by claiming it was for the greater good. The climate crowd believes that by punishing the guy with a big truck they can pay for their greater good. These representatives have made a religion out of government and climate change is their gospel. They literally believe they are saving the world from evil. It’s basically a socialist or communist version of religion where scientists write the gospel of “indisputable climate science” where if you disagree with their “consensus” then you’re a “climate change denier, a science denier and apart of the flat earth society” in order for them to label you as a heretic and that you must be silenced and punished for your blasphemy of questioning their worldview. That sounds exactly like fucking religion to me. I honestly believe that global warming so the route that the wealthy elite and their political puppets will use to enslave us all. Because of the separation of church and stay they decided the best plan would be to make the government their church, judges, sheriffs and mayors are the new priests. You’re governor, representatives and senators are you’re new cardinals and bishops. And the president is their pope. It’s why they all worshipped Obama like he was a messiah. He was literally speaking about climate change like he was going to personally lower the sea level by divine government power. It’s this level of delusion and insistence that everyone that disagrees with them is going to cause them and their children to die from climate change. This is the type of rhetoric that Alexandria occasion Cortez is using and expect the new generation of political power across the western world to start accusing those that disagree with them of “murdering future generations” they’ll paint a picture where if we try to resist their climate taxes that we are destroying the planet and our opinions can be ignored. It’s the first step towards total social and economic control by the state. This is their plan on how to achieve it.

Satanists want depopulation because God himself told humans to multiply in numbers and dominate the world. Satan and demons hate humans. That&#39;s why they posses humans sometimes. So by saying there is global warming, you&#39;re making people have less children. Some people get this image that the world is dying and broken and cuz of that they shouldn&#39;t be having children.

If you listen to what is being said the world is actually cooling not warming up , do you know when extinctions occurred throughout the worlds life it was from “ice ages “ ? in 1913 the worlds hottest temperature recorded was 56.7 degrees Celsius it has not been ever recorded again ! That was over 100 years ago bud ! And the idea you believe NASA and that propaganda that they know what is happening because satellites protects us is laughable !! That tech you think is highly advanced up there is mostly junk flawed tech just like when you buy a new iPhone and the thing has all these problems ! All technology on this planet is faulty and made like shit ! If we had perfect tech spaceships , planes and satellites would not fall out of the sky all the time !!

It is scientifically proven that global warmings through history of earth was caused naturally by high volcanic activity and large eruptions pumping Co2 into the atmosphere, which is allso visible in the same scientific excavation tubes he mentions.<br />But this guy is a sort of people i know to well. I will just mention one example in the first 2 min of the clip i watched, because i wont watch further. The sentence where he explains the southpole is on a hill, and many people get nausea because of the height difference... but he couldnt skip to squeeze into the same sentence “that it didnt affect his wife and him”.<br />Yeap, well functioning psycho set only on money and success whatever the cost, whatever the lies..<br />And most people admire this kind of scum, because everyone wants money and success.

I fundamentally disagree with this and given the absolute state of western civilization and the fucking mess we inherited i am also fucking pissed off! DId our ancestors have this attitude towards their future generations?! NO! Because if they did then we Europeans would be in jsut about the same situation as most of the rest of the world.. Our European ancestors did something that set them apart from the rest of the world.. They PLANNED AHEAD! This was something that set them apart from every other civilization and its one of the main reasons why these boomer fucks got to live in one of the best time periods in history! Now my generation has a war on its hands.. and if we sit back and simply say what this man is saying then our children wont even have a civilization at all! They will simply exist as a hated minority amoungst the broken statues of their ancestors.. You two men should see the writing on the wall... One of you is in LONDON for fucks sake..

As the vortex pulls clouds and at the same time fueled by sea waters blown up to it, the artificial hurricane formed. It was then guided by other towers/ HAARP laser beams to its journey from Africa to Texas, to punish the Texans, este, to drown them so that it would be easy... yeah, much much easier to dis-gun them (read: take away their guns) if and when their houses are flooded, isn't it? Now, they figured it out that the waters fetched on the way might be not sufficient, which was the case, so, so? So they created a giant teapot - in fact, 3 giant teapots to fuel the water-emptied whirlwind Harvey three times - read: 3 times! So guns, are gone. And when FEMA helicopters "saved" the helpless Texans, they were flown, over 300,000 of them, to the heart of the ocean where a number of prison ships were awaiting for them! There they were either imprisoned, thrown to the sea later or butchered into meat - read: human meat - to supply McDonald and other Illuminati burger / meat-using businesses! That's the long story cut short and... complete. Now, it is your duty to trace those videos et al that prove these things. We have already downloaded enough of them.

This effectively makes the radiation energy stay longer in the atmosphere which results in quantitatively more energy in that same atmosphere. More energy produces more heat.

It's actually because Earth has an atmospheric lapse rate combined with the fact that gas molecules (and solid/liquid surfaces) transmit that LWR in a quantity that's proportional to temperature (LWR quantity = temperature**4 * 5.6704 / 100,000,000, Stefan-Boltzmann). The lapse rate (5-10 degrees / km, average 6.8 degrees / km) means that the gases transmit LWR to space in smaller quantity than the surface would if the gases weren't in the way because the GHGs are, of course, much higher up than the surface. As you said, the difference warms the atmosphere. It's 83% of LWR (200 w/m**2) sent to space is from the GHGs, 17% (40 w/m**2) is LWR direct from the surface of the oceans (and a bit from land too) to space.

Neither with 'how serious' people take global warming. 6:11 This reasoning is weird: 'Saudi oil company doesn't want to make their reserves public THUS climate change is a hoax.' These statements don't have any clear connection. Even if the oil company makes their (big) reserves public, it won't impact the legitimacy of climate change. (correct me if I'm wrong) 6:25 Because the climate was hotter 55000 year ago doesn't mean global warming isn't going to be devistating for life as we know it in some (most) places of the earth + the problem is the rate at which the climate is changing, not the fact that it is changing. It's always going to be changing but it's happening faster than ever before. 6:33 I'm just going to ignore the hyperbolic rethoric here. 7:40 I'm expecting some big arguments here! 7:50 The opinion of those 12 rich and/or important people who have set foot on both the North- and South Pole doesn't have any influence on the validity of climate change. Also, 12 is a rather small sample-size. Also, you are disregarding all the scientists who have been on one or both Poles and do believe in climate change.

His crack team is a bunch of yes men who tell him what he wants to hear. <br />There has been a permanently manned station at the South Pole since 1956. You can take a cruise to the North Pole if you wish. Then there are numerous scientists who have traveled to both poles. I dont imagine that the exact number of folks who have visited both poles would be recorded anywhere. He talks like an egomaniac who would thrive in business but not in science. <br /><br />Also his theory that if Global Warming was real, the wealthy business people would not invest in long-term investments.<br />Let&#39;s look at history... How many times have most business people made huge mistakes? Financial collapses, Nations and Empires like Spain destroyed, and they never saw it coming. <br />Well, there were few people warning them... did they listen? <br /><br />He is charismatic. Must be a great businessman he has the ego maniac tendencies to thrive in such environments. But he is no prophet. A man surrounded by yes men and other ego driven wealthy people. Have been wrong many times and ruined their long-term investments throughout history. <br /><br />Just like I would not go to a doctor for a financial decision we should be worried to take advice from business people about heart surgery. <br /><br />Oh, but the scientist are corrupted. Well, I bet some of them are. But there is a longer history of the wealthy business people being just as corrupted. So call out those and demand to prove they are not corrupted. Just as hard as you go after those scientists.	UCJNQ_cDtft_33-rJR8gigFQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJNQ_cDtft_33-rJR8gigFQ	0

The earth was 2 degrees warmer around 100,000 years ago or so and warmed up by 2 degrees over 20,000 years and went back down. We are doing the same but over 200 years quite a big difference. Secondly, the first electric car was made in 1828 not 1840s and was slow, not affordable and the internal combustion engine was cheaper and massed produced in 1920. He should go to New Zealand and see why he gets sun burnt so easily but not anywhere else. Cause the ozone is a lot less down there then anywhere else. <br /><br />This guy does not know what he is talking about, he should really go to greenland and see the ice melting all the time.

Global warming is real you fucking morons cause it&#39;s happened many times before as admitted by this same asshole screaming in this video. We are in a period of heating as we speak. The earth has had periods of heat when there was high co2 greenhouse gas and loss of plant life. Cooling when there was low co2 and abundance of plant life. Many other natural events like volcanic eruptions have also brought temperature change. The only difference now is we are in the mix adding to whatever the natural state of the earth is. We are currently not planting more trees and growing forests or rainforest. We are clearing land at an unsustainable rate to farm, so much farming that we are doing it in the oceans and ruining that as well. Don&#39;t be ignorant. In the past when the earth has cooled or heated up, you can bet the farm it wasn&#39;t a happy time.....Duhhhhhh	UC7rKDzNAgdKZ476snDJyjeA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7rKDzNAgdKZ476snDJyjeA	0

He show signs of jealousy of our experts &quot;MIT&quot; yell, they are the experts, they didn&#39;t study all those years not to know anything. But he is right about one thing, it is nothing environmental. Okay. That you can buy, but believe me and I do not lie to you. Not only is their global warming, sort of speak -- what a filthy mouth this guys has, eww and double eww. All scientists are lying but he&#39;s right Give me a break. Not only is there global warming this has nothing to do with the natural process of global warmings of the past, forget that, that&#39;s just normal conditions, THIS MY FRIENDS IS NOT. I CANNOT SAY WHY ONLY THAT IT IS, YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TURN TO YOUR FAITH. ALL THE ANSWERS YOU NEED ARE THERE AND IN THE GOOD BOOK, THE BIBLE. This man, I don&#39;t know who is and with that filthy dirty mouthed person. I pay no attention to. He&#39;s a self-gloating fool. Let me explain something for your consideration, look at what happened during those periods of temperature change, the world was destroyed DESTROYED TWICE BY FLOODS AN ONE TIME BY FIRE. HMM? Let me tell you, what will happen here and rather rapidly, is that the rays of the Sun will continue to get hotter and our soil will dry up, hmm? THE SOIL WILL DRY AND MOST WILL PERISH HERE. Someone tell this jerk to shut his filthy mouth. Eww. THE SOIL WILL DRY, FORGET WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST IN TEMPERATURE FORGET THAT, THIS HAS NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT OR ANYTHING ENVIRONMENTAL, THE RAYS OF THE SUN ARE GROWING STRONGER AND THAT&#39;S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW. IS THERE A CURE, YES BUT IT WOULD HAVE EXTEND FROM EACH AND EVERYONE OF US AND THAT WON&#39;T HAPPEN. TURN TO YOUR FAITH IT IT IS ALL THERE. YES THERE IS A SERIOUS EVENT OCCURRING IN TEMPERATURE &quot;RANGE&quot; AND IF YOU DO NOT TURN TO YOUR FAITH, AND WORSHIP GOD, AND STOP YOUR SINNING BY HOUSING, EMBRACING AND SWAYING AND OBEYING TO SATAN&#39;S POWER YOUR SOIL WILL DRY AND FOOD WILL BE SCARCE. MANY OF YOU WILL BE WIPED OFF THE PLANET. HEY, DON&#39;T GET MAD AT ME AND TELL ME TO TAKE MY MEDS, I&#39;LL TAKE EM LATER, I UNDERSTAND HOW CRAZY THIS SOUNDS TA YAS, BUT I ALSO KNOW, YOU ALREADY WHAT I SAY IS TRUE, YOU FEEL THE SUNS RAYS HOTTER AT 5 PM THAN AT HIGH NOON. THE GLARE OF THE SUN JUST BEFORE SUN SET IF FAR MORE STRONGER THAN IT WAS, IT LITERALLY IS NOW BLINDING YOU. WE ARE AT WAR AND I BELIEVE MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT TOO, BUT IT NOT BETWEEN MEN, IT IS BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL. GOD HAS SENT HIS SAINTS AND THEY ARE HERE AND IN PLACE AND THEY WARN BUT THAT IS ALL THEY CAN DO, IS PROTECT AND WARN, THEY FIGHT EVIL AND EXPOSE THE EVIL SO YOU AND EACH OF YOU CAN SEE IT, THIS GUY IS EVIL RIGHT HERE WITH NARCISSISTIC MOUTH GOING OFF IN FILTH THAT NO ONE WANTS TO BELIEVE A WORD HE SAYS, I SURE DIDN&#39;T I DON&#39;T EVEN KNOW WHAT PINK TIE EVEN SAID BUT IN ANY EVENT, CERTAINLY HE IS NO AUTHORITY GOD IS.

Satellite data shows that layer of atmosphere has actually COOLED slightly, meaning our warming is being caused internally, inside the heat-trapping layer of C02. Did you also know that the burning of fossil fuels leaves a "signature" in the atmosphere that scientists can read? By measuring the ratio of light to carbon atoms, they know that our current warming is not coming from natural cycles or the sun, ocean or earth, but specifically from burning fossil fuels? You just repeated what oil industry propaganda has trained you to repeat. Please check the science for yourself. NASA, NOAA or the Union of Concerned Scientists are great websites to start at.

The ozone layer has nothing to do with global warming.<br />We are causing global warming. That has been proven long ago. All pieces of the puzzle are there and have been there for decades now.<br /><br />1. We know that by burning hydrocarbons CO2 is emitted (CmHn +O2 -&gt; CO2 + H2O). That&#39;s simple chemistry. We also know if you burn 1kg of coal you&#39;ll produce about 3-4kg of CO2. For gaseline it&#39;s about 2kg.<br /><br />2. We know the absorptions spectrum of CO2. Therefore we know what happens when you have more CO2 in the atmosphere. It&#39;s not difficult to figure it out either. Far easier than predicting the weather for example, since it&#39;s simply about energy balances. Atmospheric physics deals with such problems in case you&#39;re interested in the math. Obviously more CO2 increases the average global surface temperature. It has to be that way. The physics demands it.<br /><br />3. We know that the additional CO2 in the atmosphere comes from the combustion of fossil fuels. We know this because fortunately CO2 from fossil fuels consists of different carbon isotopes than other sources of CO2. So we can simply take samples from the atmosphere and quickly figure out if the cabon comes from the combustion of fossil fuels or not. Such analyses showed that we are indeed responsible for the increased CO2.<br /><br />4. Figuring out what can influence the average global temperature is quite easy. It&#39;s simply about how much energy the earth abosorbs and how much it emits (radiative balance).So we&#39;ve figured out long ago what&#39;s able to influence the global temperature and how much it can influence the temperature. With this knowledge we can exclude various things as the cause of global warming and the only thing that&#39;s left as the cause of the current warming is CO2. <br /><br />We are causing it and we&#39;ve caused all of it. And of coursemore CO2 in the atmosphere will cause an even higher increase in temperature.And don&#39;t forget that the earth hasn&#39;t reached it&#39;s equilibrium temperature for 400ppm yet. So even if we stopped burning fossil fuels now the earth would still warm further. All of this is known, there are some uncertainties, but we know that CO2 warms the planet and by how much. The uncertainties come from feedback loops and possible tipping points. After all the earth is quite a complicated system. If you get rid of the ice on the poles for example you will replace a white reflective surface with a dark absorbant ocean. Furthermore methane will be released if the permafrost melts in certain areas. This type of stuff is more difficult to quantify. What should worry you is that the uncertainties all favour higher temperatures. So we are very certain that the earth will warm quite a bit and certainly won&#39;t cool, but it could also warm quite a bit more because of the known uncertainties.<br /><br />Such a global experiment should not be taken lightly. It&#39;s foolish if you ask me.	UCjP2lc8Y8XuZvDfIsuyUs3g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjP2lc8Y8XuZvDfIsuyUs3g	0

Or have you been manipulated to believe that by the over $100 million in donations Koch Industries and Exxon (according to Greenpeace investigations of publicly available tax forms) have made to 87 different organizations and especially The Heartland Institute (the same organization that worked for years with the tobacco industry to try and convince people tobacco smoke was harmless) to plant seeds of doubt about climate change? These organizations put up bogus videos (with presentations dressed up as actual science) throughout the Internet (whenever you see a sponsor called The Friends of Science or similar, run); they pay fringe scientists (almost never an actual climatologist (one is a professor of geography, for example) to make the rounds of conservative radio and TV, but particularly Fox, and try to convince you that human-fueled climate change is fake. They paid one fringe "scientist" $1.2 million to do this in a single year. They also do mass mailings of climate change DVDs and books (the oil industry's version, of course) to EVERY K-12 science teacher in the country in order to sway students to their way of thinking. They publish various online publications and frequent their pages with climate change denial articles and columns. Chances are 100% that you have been exposed to their materials in one form or another. Together, Koch Industries and Exxon is responsible for more C02 in the atmosphere than any other conglomerates in the world. Koch Industries, in fact, has been fined more times by the EPA than any other company. Think about that when you listen to or read their propaganda. You have been duped.

Anyone who cares about the truth can find it, but believe me its not what these demon led deceivers are saying. Everything Nasa has done is absolutely a lie and fake 100 percent for sure. Anyone can follow the smoke trails from any shuttle launch and see the shuttle never goes into space. Anyone can search for images of Satellites, and earth from space and see there all cgi and fake. Anyone can search and see how Nasa fakes space walks in a giant swimming pool with mock satellites, and divers filming them, and then you can observe the air bubbles coming up during live space walks correlating the truth on that matter. Anyone can search and see how they use Zero G planes to fake weightlessness on videos for fake space station which is produced by doing parabolic dives inside of airplane studio. Anyone can search and see how they use harnesses and blue screens as well. I am baffled by how deceived everyone is, and how some people have such a hard time coming to the knowledge of the truth. Use your own eyes and stop believing these lying assholes who have sold their souls in taking part in deceiving everyone. We are absolutely getting robbed like were a bunch of Idiots, because most peoples hearts are in the wrong place and people want all this nonsense to be true. Over 800 million dollars for the most recent lie about going to Mars. There is no real proof that this even happen. You have a cartoon artist representation of the lander, a video clip of a room full of people celebrating, and a couple crappie photos. No real proof especially not over 850 million dollars worth. Have you ever looked at your satellite dish which is static facing one direction and asked yourself how it stays connected to an orbiting satellite? Especially when there are supposed to be thousands of satellites, and thousands of users. Why the need for any satellite when we have the undersea cables connecting the continents for internet and phone, and we have all these cell/radio towers everywhere? Most importantly you can&#39;t find real images of them when searching for satellite images online. To me it is so clear that satellites aren&#39;t real and its a part of the big lie. All the sheep are being led astray because you pick demonic shepherds to guide you for your truth. You will end up one day waking up to the fact that you have been deceived but it will probably be too late. Repent while you can, and seek the truth. I will not waste a second replying to Nasa shills paid to come here and attempt to psychologically manipulate people from seeing the truth. There is nothing you could ever say to make all that fake stuff real. I too was brain washed from a child to believe all these lies but now I see the truth. Please be open minded and seek the truth for yourself. When you see the truth you will realize how evil and corrupt all these sell outs are.

The majority of scientists back then were warning of warming, not an ice age. There were a small number scientists "speculating" on a possible ice age, due to temporary oscillations in the Pacific and other factors, which we now fully understand. There was NO consensus back then. There were not thousands of peer-reviewed, scientific papers published then as there are now. National academies of science or major scientific institutions around the world were not backing this speculation at all. It was mostly sensationalist articles appearing in lay magazines like Time and Newsweek (not actual science journals) that caused a brief splash, and the deniers have turned that tiny handful of scientists into something much bigger than they ever were.

The oceans warming takes hundreds of years to change. Dont worry about icecaps.<br />Yes, there is global warming. Its natural and started BEFORE the industrial revolution.

They also know from satellite temperature readings (taken since 1978) that the outer layer of the atmosphere has cooled slightly, further evidence that warming is not due to greater solar energy but that generated by heat-trapping C02 lower down. It's true that by comparison humans create only a small amount of C02 compared with all natural sources, but the excess we produce tips the natural balance, resulting in changes to the climate. See NASA, NOAA or the Union of Concerned Scientists websites for information on this.

Libretards think that an increase in CO2 is what causes a rise in the global temperature, hence, the fake cry of, limit greenhouse gases like cow farts (California actually passed a bill restricting cow farting/methane). Actually, CO2 is what makes plants grow and increases the flow of oxygen to our body to help prevent cancer. Commercial greenhouses uses about 1200 ppm of CO2. They use CO2 generators.

C02 does indeed help plants grow but only up to a point. C02 saturation hurts plants and depletes them of nutrients including, in wheat, protein. But increases in massive rainfalls and extended droughts will decimate more plants than C02 helps.

That there is not even correlation, never mind a causation, or that, in spite of all these self-congratulatory climate summits, CO2 kept increasing? It is already clear that politics is incompetent at anything it (pretends to) try,but in my mind that is sheer treason. They deliberately atteeempt to maximize CO2, in teh hoes of cauasing catastrophic climate change (which they either do believe in, or they only use it as a tool to force their way on a defenseless population.<br />In a way it offers hope, because apparenntly they fear us sufficiently to lie about this so elaborately.

Both pass thru the atmosphere and are absorbed by the surface of the Earth and converted to kinetic energy (heat). This heat is emitted back outward as thermal radiation aka IR. A significant amount of this IR is reabsorbed by the denser atmospheric gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etcetera. This excites their molecular structure and the resulting kinetic energy re-emits IR. Life on Earth is made possible by the capturing of enough IR to keep the biosphere warm enough to sustain life. As the heavier molecules in the atmosphere increase, the amount of IR also increases.<br /><a href="https://samslair.blogspot.com/search?q=Greenhouse+Effect&amp;m=1">https://samslair.blogspot.com/search?q=Greenhouse+Effect&amp;m=1</a>	UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA	0

Torzyk	Global warming a HOAX A SCAM TO STEAL FROM THE PEOPLE...Anyone who says otherwise is spreading FAKE information.....What is the temperature change of planet Earth? The answer is .... since 1850 until 2018 the temperature has varied a total of plus or minus one degree depending upon the accuracy of the measuring apparatuses. The measurements are taken at various locations around the planet. It&#39;s no surprise then that when the results indicate a &quot; ZERO° &quot; CHANGE ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE ENTIRE PLANET, that is the temperature of the Earth has been stable for the 178 years that it has been watched. Do your own due dilligents and find out for yourself. Ex President Obama, knew it , he was given proof, he lied about the actual numbers because he wanted to push his own sick agenda. Weather on Earth is dynamic, that is it&#39;s always moving and local weather changes getting colder in new places and warmer in others. Ice melts in one area and new ice is formed in a new region etc. IE local changes in climate does not result in the temperature rise of the planet, the core temperature will probably decrease....

Otherwise, you are exactly the kind of morons that think the earth is secretly flat and lizard people walk among us. ;)	UCalyCu3qSBanVVtp_7zxl_A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCalyCu3qSBanVVtp_7zxl_A	0

Read a little what scientists actually say, and take a look at what ice core samples tell us. The rise of Co2 comes AFTER the rise in temperature. People need to learn to adjust to the change and quit trying to fleese people out of their money, Al-gore is.

They will continue to believe it's a hoax. They've already made up their minds. It's impossible to convince anyone based on this sort of mindset. Just walk away. They are set in their ways. Unfortunately this is the reality of what it has come to. They refuse to do their own homework and then listen to one guy on a youtube video who thinks he has all the answers and all of a sudden they have all the answers too. This is why we can never overcome the problems we now face today. Nearly 2/3 of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is now bleached and in ruins and will soon be a thing of the past. The Florida Keys are not too far behind as well as all shallow water reefs across the globe. I've seen it with my own eyes and witnessed it. To them, it's just the earth changing and doing it's thing. No one is going to believe global warming until they have been personally affected by it. If you haven't been personally affected by it, it's not real.	UC0dMZ6S87bR-4eDeMB6SwWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0dMZ6S87bR-4eDeMB6SwWA	1	Ugx6dt6sqm81nI1DVKV4AaABAg	Jeph Bennett

The correlation between C02 rising since the industrial age and the temperature increase is statistically significant with a percent chance of being fluke... not to mention if you ignore global warming completely, fossil fuels are still just straight up dirty and pollution kills 7 million people a year. Educate yourself about clean nuclear energy if you want to see the solution and spread the word. I&#39;m not bipolar, I&#39;m rational.

Well its found deeper than any fossil has been found. 30,000 ft. The earth constantly makes it within the mantle. Its one of the most prolific liquids on earth. Why does it have to take millions of years? We can make crude oil from hydrocarbons in hours, can you imagine the pressure forces under the earth? The "peak oil" myth is how companies produce false scares that they are running low on oil. They make a fortune manipulating the prices making the rich , richer. Oil is not a fossil fuel.

It&#39;s as crazy as cats fighting. ..Someone (in a comment below) has gone quite nuts saying scientific theories can not be proven, only disproven/falsified.....This is my reply: 20181209: You are wrong! .Scientific theories are ideas/hypotheses that have been proven. Proven means: Demonstrated by evidence or argument to be true or existing....Every time you drive a car and see the road is clear to proceed, your eyes are proving to you the road is clear. Deep philosophical questions of reality have NEVER stop me from using proven scientific theories to make my life abundantly pragmatic. I am assured by science that when I go to a flush toilet and shit, my shit goes to Heaven where I will one day join it. Of course, if you can disprove this scientific theory, even if it takes the rest of you life here on Earth, I would encourage you to do so. But please, try adding to Climatology constructively. Put up a good proof and argue it with experts who understand what you&#39;re saying. If I can understand then it probably is not worth being peer reviewed. Unless you are my peer.

On the flip side of people saying climate change is a money making scheme, Dan Pena had a financial interest in the oil industry. Probably fair to assume he still has some gain in it, or at least friends in the business who gain from using fossil fuels. It seems much more believable that an oil company could pay off a small amount of individuals who deny climate change, compared to paying off the majority of people who agree with it . I realise I&#39;m in a lucky position to be able to say this. Not everyone can afford any further taxes, but if there is any tax increase towards the climate change issue, I&#39;m happy to pay my share of it. Looking forward to switching to an electric car.

It melted ice multiple thousands of feet thick, Created the Great Lakes, created water flows that would make Niagara Falls look like a trickle. What caused that warming? It made Florida 1/3 the size it was before. Separated North America and the old world. What caused all of that?

Some comments here are suggesting to “just trust your instincts” or just “use your common sense.” The scientific method gives us a way to reach verifiable, repeatable consensus. Otherwise we would have a hodgepodge of anecdotes, misinformation, and personal feelings and opinions. No, I don’t think science can give us all the answers, not even close. But I do believe it can answer what’s happening to our planet, and what will happen if we don’t take decisive action to get off the track we are on. I do also believe it’s the best tool we have to understand the physical world and arrive at something concrete we can agree is true. What better tool do we have? “Just trust your instincts.” Give me a fucking break. 😂	UCkQ3i5eKNH3dxp-DPNu8k1g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQ3i5eKNH3dxp-DPNu8k1g	1	Ugynay-EpPmYy3hKl0d4AaABAg	Steven Ewald

There were many examples in biology studies where one study was made and a conclusion of it was seen as the only right one. Then few years later another study turned out that the previous one is totally false. Then the next one after few years finds again another evidence which made the previous one false. You guys need to stop acting like scientist can define everything 100% right just because they re scientists. Just use your own common sense. Behind every study there is a money provider and a lobby. If you think otherwise you re naive as fuck. Scientist are not the good guys who are there to tell you things just to make your life better, they re workers like the oil industry guy you blame. You re a bunch of hypocrites who cant stand the truth, because this whole global warming swindle has become your obsession.

Look up the milankovitch cycles and go back thousands of years. Science is never absolute. It always changes. I have a BS in physics, with a minor in Biology. Don’t tell me I’m not qualified to speak on such. Climate change IS a man made FEAR that we have NO control of. Scientist get government funding to instill this fear in the gullible youth. If these climate scientist admit there is no such thing as man made climate change, they lose their funding, plain and simple. IE; will have to find another grant from some other financial institute. You gonna stop the solar rays and solar flares? How about the oceans cycling, how you gonna tackle that one? You gonna stop the earth from tilting on its axis? What about volcanos erupting, gonna stop them too? How about humans exhaling CO2? Ok, look... the best thing humans can do is what we have always done.

UgzHOPDD-LkjWCKaZxV4AaABAg	0	1	2018-12-07 00:09:49	Mr. Fixit	What did it for me is the demonstrable fact that the ice caps on Mars (they are largely CO2) lost ice at the same time the Earth was warming, then over the last 18 years they stabilized as the Earth has ceased warming, and are now building again as the Earth cools. The sun is the primary climate driver and we are headed for a solar grand minimum now. One thing about the Ozone layer: The science said that it takes 100 years for fluorocarbons to break down and that the Ozone layer would probably all but disappear before the massive amount of fluorocarbons released in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s would be naturally oxidized and disappear. Now they are saying that the holes are all fixed. If they were right before, that is simply not possible.	UC_kvStwh6f-CfHuJ6vcv3pQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_kvStwh6f-CfHuJ6vcv3pQ	0

Thousands of scientists have repeated these and other facts but get no airtime. Only Governments, globalist and researcher looking for money keep this fallacy going. They are interested in a global tax and removal of a nation’s sovereignty. All facts for all the brainwashed masses.

Will the oceans rise another 2 inches drowing everyone? And every year we hear is warmer then the last. Ask them by how much. 1 60th? Now ask the margin of error estimating the average temperature of the planet. And the .04% of the atomosphere that is CO2 is more important than spilling oil in the gulf, fracking corrupting groundwater, the island of plastic in the pacific, the nuclear waste from Fukashima. Climate change can be summed up as &quot;Send us money we will never spend on renewable energy or anything but our bank accounts, bribes to scientists and political donations. There are actual environmental concerns. They just want to tax the air and pretend they are doing something. All the real issues they ignore, but this they use to scare us out of money.

The scientific community has provided unbiased FACTS acquired through years of research. But people choose to believe Donald Trump's, Dan Penna's and similar people's opinions on the matter. Don't get me wrong, I think Donald Trump is funny and Dan Penna is a bad ass.

The reason it’s called a fossil fuel is to create the illusion that it’s limited and rare.

As long as the air you are breathing contains less than around 2% CO2 it probably won't kill you, below 1% it will not affect you unless you have some physical abnormality. Presently average CO2 is said to be 0.041% (410 ppm), so there is a lot of room to increase CO2 before it becomes a problem for humans. Incidentally, when you exhale, about 4% of your breath is CO2! Also, how fast the level of CO2 changes does not affect anything. Commercial greenhouse operations often pump CO2 into their buildings to aid plant growth and reduce water consumption. You can go from 410 ppm in the air outdoors to 1600 ppm inside the greenhouse just by stepping through the door. It does no harm. Evolution happened mostly in warmer temperatures and at higher levels of CO2, so if we could somehow increase CO2 by a factor of 4, our only observation would be healthier, faster growing plants.

Human since the discovery of the fire have been emitting CO2 in the air and in the last 2 centuries that CO2 emission has increased drastically. Is it harmful, is it not? I don't know but in a complicated sistem as the earth climate this is doing something that could turn out to be harmful to the life on earth as we know it because nothing had the time to evolve in response.

That being said, carbon monoxide is food for all our vegetation. If you truly study the ice ages you will find that the climate changed very quickly in decades in fact, and that temperatures hit a peak then dropped very quickly in all the prior cycles. If you study the Planets of our solar system they are also experiencing temperature changes, now what could be causing that boys and girls,. well perhaps our sun or maybe its a combination, all the trash in the ocean not letting the water soak up the heat. I believe we do impact the earth with our actions, but its not carbon monoxide. The problem is all the harmful chemicals our factories leak into the water and land, its the chemicals we spray on crops and are sprayed in our skies, its the plastics and other harmful trash that is in our oceans, its oil leaks that destroy our water and land and all the life it supports. so yes we impact the earth but carbon monoxide the plants food is not the problem.

I think the skeptics are right to be skeptical because the powers that be like to trick the public into passing more and more laws to control the people. That&#39;s undeniable. Even if climate change is real, you better believe the Government will use it to bolster their own agenda. Fear has always been their weapon against us. <br /><br />But with that being said, I am also skeptical of these people who swear up and down that humans couldn&#39;t possibly have any impact on their planet through their actions. There are billions and billions of people! We certainly can screw things up. On a large scale. I don&#39;t think we will be able to destroy the world. Not entirely. God won&#39;t let that happen. In fact, the Bible says God will bring to ruin those ruining the earth. <br /><br />So things are going to get bad. Do you think that means I trust the libtards? Hell no. I don&#39;t trust any of these ass holes. The problem is now climate change is a political issue, and everyone and their dog now believes they&#39;re an expert on a field of science they know next to nothing about, only what their politics tells them to believe. That&#39;s not how we should be arriving at conclusions, that includes the climate skeptics and the silly climate alarmists who haven&#39;t taken a science class since grade school.

More heat causes more evaporation from the seas and more precipitation (rainfall). Reversing desertification and more plants and trees has the effect of reducing CO2 levels. Over population is a much bigger threat to the world.	UCDQTVHF6740-ikNFntw60kA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDQTVHF6740-ikNFntw60kA	0

Add 14c on top of the summer highs in the tropics and you are talking mass death. Warmer Oceans and higher humidity means more energy being fed into the weather systems meaning more intense and deadly storms. Its basic science. America is going to feel it with more intense Tornadoes across the middle, stronger hurricanes and flooding in the south and more intense winter storms in the north thanks to warmer water temps mixing with winter arctic air.

You don't have a SHRED of any actual evidence Christ ever existed, that's why Jesus is considered a FICTIONAL character. Nothing you say or do will prove he exists unless you can PRODUCE him in the flesh, which you can't and WON'T do given he doesn't exist. So, you can fall asleep to your mythology and nonsense if you want, but the only one believing in extinct sky fairies is YOU! I don't believe in NURSERY RHYMES and ancient myths. But then I"m not mentally illl like you are. Everyone has disproven Jesus and Science has TOTALLY disproven any supernatural Gods, which leaves you with nothing.

Now global warming or climate change has been around longer than most people realize and guess what we're not in an ice age and it's not getting hotter I live in the desert it gets 120 the hottest doesn't kill you if your inside with A/C.

Or are they also like Al Gore emitting 20 times the CO2 of the average Joe?....Also if CO2 is the biggest threat to humans right now. Why would they say: " hey, you can emit CO2 just as long as you pay a CO2 tax for doing so"....They don't say: "hey, you can dump mercury, lead and radioactive waste in the ocean just as long as you pay your pollution tax"	UCOQi2dEhIXPo4Db7rqyPV6w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOQi2dEhIXPo4Db7rqyPV6w	1	UgzFM-0sbZxBR1IzmmN4AaABAg	MrMicronano

Underneath the hood that software still runs on Fortran and Cobol. It can no more predict the climate 100 years from now than a fairground astrologer reading tea leaves can.<br />Climate science is a Quack science. Unfortunately so many educated people have invested so much of their lives into it so they can continue to receive research grants that pay their mortgages and put their kids through college that they simply cannot allow the cult that has risen up around it to fail without destroying their careers.<br /> Relax and enjoy your lives. In the 1970&#39;s when I did my Physics degree at M.I.T the world&#39;s most eminent scientists predicted that a new Ice Age was imminent by the turn of the Century and Governments were actually putting plans into place to relocate the populations of northern europe to Africa to escape the Glaciers that were forecast to swamp the Northern Hemisphere.<br /> Climate science is a Quack science and its progenitors are Quacks.

It's certainly better than calling people you disagree with "scum". Also, it's accurate. The vast majority of all scientists believe human activity has increased global warming and that the planet is warming faster than at any other time in the past. These people have spent their lives studying the climate, so I'm inclined to believe them. The very nature of science is peer review, challenges to scientific assertions made *by other scientists* in the same field, not by people with political axes to grind. And it's pretty odd to be told that I do not understand what science is by someone who rejects the entirety of one discipline simply as a Marxist hoax, doesn't know how peer review works, thinks random uninformed opinion constitutes a "rational challenge", and in two long posts, had absolutely nothing to say about science other than to attack it.

This must be reduced rapidly to 1 billion people, plans put in place to return to preindustrial living. We must shut it all down and return to being hunter gatherers and be the animals mankind should be. We must stop now before we go extinct! Action by mankind must happen soon!

Trump, Berlusconi, Hitler, destructive stereotypes strongly supported by the brainless voters. Always people trying to be self justified to continue burning oil, always the example of Gore, they tried to make money of a phenomenon so the phenomenon its a lie...nice logic you smart. The hoax its being a corporation or a government with oil interests and denies the reality to continue earning insane amounts of money. Tobacco took 3 generations to the corporations recognizes its bad, for example. You can apply the same logic to any habit of capitalist lifestyle: hormone animals as food, steroids users, living in a high polluted environment, use plastic for everything, spend with no control or aware... the mostly of society will accept that when the world will be fked.

However I would like to see the patent for the electric car that came “40 or 50 fucken years”before gasoline engines. I would like to believe what he’s saying but unless there is solid evidence I’m gunna take this with a grain of salt. If he brought some paperwork that validated everything he’s stated to make a solid case, this would be a brilliant way to combat the ingrained complacency that has ripped the spine out of society’s asshole. Then handed the Keys to the kingdom over to a small group of sociopathic genocidal scum. We could be so much farther ahead of where we are if people weren’t so selfish. <br />Wherever money is present, kindness will always be challenged.

High Co2 would also increase Oxygen levels...besides the equation they use, they dont add everything that emits co2 in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere.. is there a problem? it seems that way.. But the likelyhood that co2 is causing it is so low its basically non-existent... Theres more evidence that nano- particulates like aluminum are more likely to creat the conditions we see, than CO2... and that actually has evidence to back it up..

We are in a geomagnetic reversal and entering a grand solar minimum and we just passed a peak of warmth slightly lower than the medieval warm period which was slightly lower than the Roman warm period. It&#39;s due to sun spots. We had a double Peak it was warm in the fifties and sixties then it dropped in the 70s and it was warm again in the 80s and 90s similar to the 30s and it&#39;s just been going down ever since. we should be planting trees and being against pollution we have to turn off the ionospheric heaters immediately it&#39;s blowing I heard some of the atmosphere into outer space. And the chemtrails are killing everything with free aluminum, industrial garbage - the &quot;global warming&quot; not the warming but the disasters under that label, are created by man through the Chemtrails the ionospheric heaters the storm surge creators the creation and manipulation and increasing power of hurricanes, when they create drought with an ionospheric heater it sends the moisture down the road where it becomes a much much worse storm with high winds hail lots of damage. All the bad things are deliberately created but not by consumers, but by what could be called terrorists. It&#39;s just a big land grab they want us out of the way as Jacob Rothschild said depopulation solves the problem of rebellion they want to get us before we get them at this point and just have the place to themselves there&#39;s nothing lofty about it. They do spray carbon in the Chemtrails - coal ash - there&#39;s a reason they say carbon is the cause I think they&#39;re kind of telling the truth, and Mankind is creating a lot of the disasters not all of them, but it&#39;s throughmilitary deployments not tailpipe emissions for Christ&#39;s fucking sake. They are following Agenda 21 which must be stopped.	UCKpb4_Viq1aQBouinaybtGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKpb4_Viq1aQBouinaybtGw	0

Okay, I got it, but why? Why would you do that? Does this man seem supernatural to you? If not why would you believe him over all the scientists who are underpaid and spend their lives underpaid and researching this stuff? Think about it for a moment. This man is not a supernatural entity. He seems rather ordinary to me. If I were at a crossroads where I had to pick one path that had the potential to destroy me and all I loved and cared about in this world, then saw this man versus thousands of people who were warning me to no take the other path who had no reason to warn me in that way, I think it&#39;d be a no-brainer. I tend to believe the vast majority of the humble over a single man I don&#39;t know well. It&#39;s how I would assume any rational person would behave too. Let&#39;s not forget what we are talking about here: YOUR life and the lives of all those who follow. Knowing that, do the right thing.

This isnt the first time humans thought the end was coming because the weather changed a bit for a while... If Co2 Was creating our problem, we should be able to cut a tree over a hundred years old and see spareness in the rings over the last hundred years increase further and further up untill this year... High Co2 would also increase Oxygen levels...besides the equation they use, they dont add everything that emits co2 in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere.. is there a problem? it seems that way.. But the likelyhood that co2 is causing it is so low its basically non-existent... Theres more evidence that nano- particulates like aluminum are more likely to creat the conditions we see, than CO2... and that actually has evidence to back it up.. Ground soil and water have tested positive for aluminum 1000x higher than what it should be...

I said then in the summer time it would be 150 degrees right? He then changed his answer to well the temperature is rising at 1/100 th of a degree every year. HAHA.

High Co2 would also increase Oxygen levels...besides the equation they use, they dont add everything that emits co2 in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere.. is there a problem? it seems that way.. But the likelyhood that co2 is causing it is so low its basically non-existent... Theres more evidence that nano- particulates like aluminum are more likely to creat the conditions we see, than CO2... and that actually has evidence to back it up.. Ground soil and water have tested positive for aluminum 1000x higher than what it should be... Aluminum raises ground ph.. and if PH goes over or under 7, plants cant retain certain minerals and viable nutrients... It turns in on itself and self destructs, and were seeing alot of that around the country and world in general..

Funny how the sea levels have risen faster than any other time on earth... funny how I travel to south east Asia every year and I’m told it’s hotter each year by residents, funny how the population on the planet has risen to the point that we now need to clear masses and masses of land to put thousands of land animals on it just to feed them... all contributing to the destruction of the ozone layer. But we have to listen some prick who just cares about the $$$$$. Go fuck yourself Pena. It’s like the pharmaceutical industry telling the doctors to keep selling the drugs to fix the symptoms... hide the root cause and fuck the public as long as the $£€ are flowing in. When his grandchildren are riddled with a mutating virus and eating money doesn’t get rid of it they can just think how great their lives are thanks to their greed ridden cunt of a ancestor.

Global Warming caused by humans has been successfully sold to people since the 1960&#39;s &amp; it will be sold until people realize its a theory, not fact. I could see them selling this scam 1000 years from now. Sadly its perpetrated on the young that have not lived long enough to know the previous failed predictions. Kids are taught that humans are destroying the planet, they are made to fill guilty &amp; then told its up to them to change something thats never been proven. One of humans biggest flaws is the ability to accept they might be wrong about something. Emotions get tied to theories &amp; rather than removing emotions &amp; researching facts people build a wall to protect there flawed beliefs. Its easier to fool someone than to convince them they&#39;ve been fooled. This is why history repeats its self. Humans are more likely to hold onto story&#39;s with emotional attachments. This tactic is used on many subjects.	UC-BRuonBOrOnkQJ-lIHDG4g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-BRuonBOrOnkQJ-lIHDG4g	0

Algae, lichens, and mosses are far more important to our environment. And guess what? They're having a whale of a time with the CO2 being produced, rooftops have never been greener. The oceans are turning bluer as it fills with more organisms. Climate-change-cultists hate everything yet understand nothing. They didn't appreciate Bees love industry, because the sulfur being produced by factories and mines killed off fungi and parasites that plagued their hives. Now that the industry is gone, Bee population plummeted as their natural enemies returned. Man is part of nature. The sooner these "environMENTALists" figure it out, the better.

Entire forests all over the world have disappeared, most of the northeast of america was all forest, i mean most of america had forest everywhere..there used to be giant redwoods all over the west coast Not just the little reserve of endangered redwoods we have now in Northern cali, there used to be cypress trees all over the entire south east, on land that was mainly all swamp lands.. all of florida, georgia, lousiana, N and S carolina, etc they were all forest zones, and theres an actual lineage that kept record of the entire upbringing of that swampland to real land. florida was considered hell on earth in the beginning, a few investors were kinda tricked into buying it before seeing it...ALL of canada used to be forest, all evergreens as far as the eye could see. Also the amazon is down 30+ percent and forest thinning has become a problem all over the world, especially in south america, and south america is one of our oxygen hotspots, its where tons of the earths oxygen is created because of the vast rainforest that exist there. why do you think that whole Save the Rainforest thing was so big at one point... I can go on and on about this man, thats a fraction of the deforestation from a few places.. if you believe that statement even 1 percent, i suggest you do a little history lesson in the deforestation caused by the modern era as well as forest thinning created by parasites, disease and the overwhelming Drug trade.. Paper mills have no credence to replant trees, and they are constantly being cut down, faster than they can grow. Just cutting downtrees like its going out of style and recycling just doesnt cut it.. Its one of the main reasons why Hemp is becoming decriminalized and being opted as a source a fiber.. Its infinitely more renewable than trees or anything for that matter.. its a high yield, low maintenence, low overhead resource that grows vigorously within a few months and is ready to harvest.. boasting the strongest fiber in the world that can make plastic 3X stronger than steel...

Plants use oxygen to produce energy as a living organism give out carbon dioxide as a waste product.

If you know your biology, The Age of oxygen was only possible through the elevated Co2 levels, as Co2 and oxygen have a symbiotic relationship. Two sides of the coin if you will, this has been established as correlated facts about oxygen increasing, because Not only were the mammals, insects, reptiles, and amphibians exceedingly giant, There were giant nematodes, More abundant prolific bacteria's, & micro-organisms... All of which emit Co2.. But the Trees were much larger as well as plants and fungi, so More CO2, More oxygen. Fungi is more of an organism though, it releases CO2 just like us, and its very abundant, mycelium colonies have been found to cover entire forest floors in some places, a giant living breathing network of fungus... All im saying is, i dont think CO2 is the problem here, Its an essential building block of life.. im not saying there isnt a problem, its just not what their saying it is, Because the world can obviously support much more than they lead us to believe.. the megalithic era shows us that immensely.. yeah, it was millions of years ago but that changes nothing.. the overall world itself has only begun to show changes and disruptions within the last 100 years, and thats being generous.. Temperatures have always been subjective on the planets surfaces.. It fluctuates, and in fact this warming period started over 100 200 years ago, long before we started burning fossil fuels like its going out of style.. Also gates didnt even do the equation right, he didnt add even 5% of the life that actually emit CO2, He only added humans.. When in fact, most of the natural world has a relationship with it..

Not just in the US, but other governments too.. I believe a silent war is being waged right now, believe me or not.. But our government has mentioned controlling and weaponizing weather on several if not a dozen different times and also has china and russia.. theres over 300 different weather programs here in america, and most of them are classified, we know their company name and an idea maybe based what the name implies, but not what they actually do inside.. We know the government is funding geoengineering at a staggering rate, and we know through meteorologist that most of our storms present day are erradic and unnatural considering past models and theres alot of visual evidence that these storms are being manipulated through timed photography, radar, and other meteorological tools.. where meteorologist have actually analyzed and shown constant inconsistencies in the storms make-ups and how they form to begin with and how they react with the surrounding eviroment to build strength. so While i believe pollution may be one side of the dice that makes up our problem here.. I think most of this is being instigated, are you aware of the economic control that can be exerted through weather manipulation.. Drop 20 ft of snow on russia for the first few months of spring, or china.. these things are possible.. world record breaking F5 tornado's as wide as Manhattin touching the ground for record breaking times.. while 60 other tornados also rampaged... that actually happened in joplin, and it surely wasnt a natural event and theres some substantial evidence that it wasnt. Catagory 6 typhoons dragging dozens of giant tanker ships into the phillipines killing almost half a million people.. No, this isnt just a weather war, Its depopulation at its best, because the people that die first are lucky. The death waves come in the calamity, when suffering from malnutrition and infection, people that need Insulin or dialyses, or the eldery that just cant traverse across the millions and millons of acres of just pure hell and carnage, with a rusty slimey nail covered in flood gunk ever other step sticking out everywhere you look. alot of people just end up dying from infection, from cuts on the flood material, all that moisture builds up bacteria quick, not to mention all the sludge from sewers and plumbing and even septic tanks come bursting out of the ground, and all the trash in the city gets mixed in with it. floods are just terrible...

The aluminum is a possibility, however the amount required to cause a problem is not known. It's easy to prove that increases in CO2 will feed all plant life, the new vigorously healthy plants will reward us with Oxygen. OXYGENATED we will be more vigorous and expell CO2. LOL... The effects on the big picture , global atmosphere are probably zero. The effects on ozone probably zero, as we cannot accurately measure the climate in a room full of people, so how can we measure the ozone. We are not sure if ozone has changed or has moved around. The atmosphere is dynamic ever changing. To know if we are changing something , we must first measure it. And are ability to do that is questionable at best. First we must learn how to measure a continuously changing environment, then the measurements must be accurate and repeatable. Then establish a baseline so we have something to compare. As far as CO2 is concerned, we dont know how much is to much and with the ozone how thin is to thin or ??

Majority of today's oxygen was generated by green algae, not trees. Plus green algae grows faster than trees and uses the largest surface on earth, the ocean. Trees and green plants only take up about 29% of the earth's surface as land. The other 71% is covered in water and algae. Fuck trees, plant algae.

High Co2 would also increase Oxygen levels...besides the equation they use, they dont add everything that emits co2 in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere.. is there a problem? it seems that way.. But the likelyhood that co2 is causing it is so low its basically non-existent... Theres more evidence that nano- particulates like aluminum are more likely to creat the conditions we see, than CO2... and that actually has evidence to back it up.. Ground soil and water have tested positive for aluminum 1000x higher than what it should be... Aluminum raises ground ph.. and if PH goes over or under 7, plants cant retain certain minerals and viable nutrients... It turns in on itself and self destructs, and were seeing alot of that around the country and world in general.. High aluminum levels in the atmosphere would also cause drought and various dramatic conditions that were actually seeing right now...

And I'm not going to sit here and make excuses for Islam, it's a radical faith compared to say pretty much ever other religion. How many people you seeing getting killed these days in the name of christianity?.....buddhism?....you see my point... and referring to shit people did a long time ago is just irrelevant, you know how many mentally I'll people we sterilized in the name of science....how many animals are used for testing in the name of science???? My point here is not to bad mouth science either as I am a firm believer in good science, my point is people are bad, and culture can be but to just start attacking various cultures and beliefs because of dumb shit they were doing in the 1800's in beyond unfair. Look either way you seem like someone who has very strong opinions so let me offer you a word of advice.... if you want convince other people of your beliefs, which clearly you do or we wouldn't even be having this conversation, the one sure fire way to make sure you never get you point across is resorting to attack other people with personal insults it doesnt make anyone even want to talk to you let alone actually change their mind, it just makes you look stupid.

All I'm sayimg is pollution is obviously bad but co2 does not seem like not the worst offender, obviously there is much of it in the atmosphere with or with out us and untill we can scientifically identify exactly what would be going on without us contributing it's just not going to go anywhere. Now I get that the US utilizes a lot of fossil fuels but we have many technological advances that in the scenario that we were to stop using them, we would be able to lean on other forms of energy see wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, etc. Many smaller impoverished countries that rely stricktly on fossil fuels would be screwed completely if they were say... outlawed by the UN and yes many many people would die. I get that we need a cleaner earth, I'm totally with you there all I'm saying is cutting out the fossil fuels is not the answer. I'm not sure if I'm just not understanding what it is you are saying but I'm surely not out in left field nor can your really say I have no basis for saying what I am. Maybe you misunderstood?

Let me start by saying I am I know way religious, I dont follow any faith and I am skeptical of climate change. Most people I have seen that are also skeptical do not use religion as a basis to discredit man made climate change, to be clear I am not saying this doesnt happen I'm just saying it's not frequent at least In the surplus of videos, articles, studies I have read. You are not going to catch me arguing with you about science disproving religion time and time again but the idea that you cant disagree with out religion being involved is intellectually disingenuous, and for the record the churches haven been vastly in the way since the days that they were physically involved it government process like in the days of Nicholas Copernicus and the discovery of calculus. There is plenty of science that can contribute to the converse of man made climate change that even NASA took part in, see article on their website about the ice gain in the arctic. Either way I'm not saying that it is impossible or that I'm right in anyway I just think their is a lot of information out there and because of it this is very much still an open debate. Now all that being said I'm very open to having my mind changed because I'm a rational person but I'll tell you what's not going to change my mind or anyones for that matter is verbally attacking and insulting someone because they disagree with you. It does disservice to everyone involved and likely ends a conversation before it begins. To make it even worse to accuse me of being responsible is ridiculous, you dont know me or know anything I do and not that you deserve it but I let you know a little something, i have put countless ours in my own community in effort to stop pollution and have cleaned up highways, streams, sewers etc, I even went door to door explaining to people why even washing their cars in their driveways is harmful because of run off to the sewers go directly to the stream. I really didnt need to tell you any of that but I'm trying to make a point that you should not assume things about other people you dont know much less accuse them of being part of them problem when you really have not idea, but I'll spin this back at you because clearly you're in for a reality check.... it's people like YOU that are the reason nothing ever gets accomplished in debates like these because rather than engaging in a civil discourse you feel the need to make an ass of yourself and attack the person because they dont agree with you. YOU shut down conversations and make no one on the other side of the conversation want to even try to understand you side because you are an arrogant bigoted demagogue who cant stand to hear anything but your own voice.

"Darwin's theory of evolution" synonyms: hypothesis, thesis, conjecture, supposition, speculation, postulation, postulate, proposition, premise, surmise, assumption, presumption, presupposition, notion, guess, hunch, feeling, suspicion; More a set of principles on which the practice of an activity is based. "a theory of education" an idea used to account for a situation or justify a course of action. "my theory would be that the place has been seriously mismanaged" fact /fakt/Submit noun a thing that is known or proved to be true. "the most commonly known fact about hedgehogs is that they have fleas" synonyms: reality, actuality, certainty, factuality, certitude; More information used as evidence or as part of a report or news article. "even the most inventive journalism peters out without facts, and in this case there were no facts" synonyms: detail, piece of information, particular, item, specific, element, point, factor, feature, characteristic, respect, ingredient, attribute, circumstance, consideration, aspect, facet; More used to refer to a particular situation under discussion. noun: the fact that "despite the fact that I'm so tired, sleep is elusive" The 2 are so far apart as you could say one is religious and one is science. if you believe theory is the same as a fact , then i make the factual statement your believe in the unbelievable , because religion muddies the mind , and your mind is obviously black from mud.

It's a very simple elemental compound. It's genesis is irrelevant to its molecular structure and it's subsequent absorption in the atmosphere. Also plants don't inhale, it's more of an absorption process. An increase of CO2, being plant food, increases global foliage, which is a good thing increasing crops, habitats and so forth. There isn't any definitive proof combustion CO2 emissions have led to a rise in global temps due to a greenhouse effect. There also isn't any proof an increase in global temps will lead to "disaster". This is just a line you're being fed, you've been duped. A rise in global temps could be beneficial, more places to grow food, more places to live and it will happen gradually which will give time for coastal and equatorial relocation if needed. But, you know, if you want to live in fear and anxiety about catastrophic global warming and give your hard earned money to the gov't so they can waste it on useless "fixes" have at it, but don't ask me to join the charade.

However, the sun is at a solar minmum now (few sunspots), so the temperature should be lower... However, the last decade, it has been rising constantly (except for one year I think) So I guess that must mean that there is something else going on. I wonder what that could be...

Biomass releases CO2, but it also stores it. Volcanos release CO2, but its also stored in limestones. humans release CO2, but.... no. no but. we are just releasing CO2. the CO2 flux is in imbalance and thats why, while we only release 3% of the CO2 into the atmosphere, around 30% of the CO2 content in the atmosphere is currently anthropogenic. imagine a bathtub. you let water flow in with 10 liters per minute and the bathup loses 10 liters per minute. now you increase the input by 0.3 liters per minute and leave the house for a week. aside from beeing broke due to wasting that much water, what does your house look like on your return?

Global warming is the biggest hoax in modern man&#39;s history. The planet on itself produces more CO2 then all human emissions combined. It is scientifically proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no global warming, only climate change (that&#39;s why mainstream shifted to climate change rhetoric) and these are cycles of nature and there is nothing anyone can do about it, no matter what taxes you pay. The universe will do what it always does and that is to breath and work in cycles, so humans better adapt. Great video.

High Co2 would also increase Oxygen levels...besides the equation they use, they dont add everything that emits co2 in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere.. is there a problem? it seems that way.. But the likelyhood that co2 is causing it is so low its basically non-existent... Theres more evidence that nano- particulates like aluminum are more likely to creat the conditions we see, than CO2... and that actually has evidence to back it up.. Ground soil and water have tested positive for aluminum 1000x higher than what it should be... Aluminum raises ground ph.. and if PH goes over or under 7, plants cant retain certain minerals and viable nutrients...

And heres the truth ( notice you never posted this.) Climate Misinformation by Source: Christopher Monckton Christopher Monckton is a British consultant, policy adviser, writer, columnist, and hereditary peer. While not formally trained in science, Monckton is one of the most cited and widely published climate skeptics, having even been invited to testify to the U.S. Senate and Congress on several occasions. For a comprehensive rebuttal of many of Christopher Monckton's arguments, check out this presentation by Professor John Abraham. Abraham has compiled many examples where Monckton misrepresents the very scientists whose work he cites. Check out this PDF of Monckton quotes versus the scientists who in their own words explain how Monckton misrepresents their research. And hers the website: https://www.skepticalscience.com/Monckton_Myths_arg.htm I do not believe anything a tosser like this moncton has to say , he no credibility apart from being a bullshit artist , in fact exactly as much credibility as you, which the credibility equal to witches being real but people are still killed in Jesus name for being a witch.

The whole climate change thing IS a hoax. It's not everyday people who are killing the planet, it's the gl0bal el1tes, just look up into the sky on almost any given day, and see all of the criss cross chemtrails, and if you don't know anything about chemtrails, go to geoengineering watch website, lot's of good info.

Those who haven&#39;t survived are gullible, naive about the Environment (sorry, usually women)! A friend was suckered in to installing a water meter by an environmental Feminazi colleague to cut down on water wastage! She&#39;s now paying nearly £80.00 a month to Thames Water, she&#39;s a light user, recycles dish water for her plants and a toilet with a half flush. She&#39;s regrets this decision, now she&#39;s retired she can&#39;t afford it and a recent news report revealed Thames Water has had 36,000 leaks in the past 6 years and millions of gallons of water is wasted each year. What the altruists like that FemiNazi do is guilt trip gullible, poor people in to becoming poorer, wasting their money and time for futile globalist causes to enrich corporations, not the environment! .

Ugwfm3xLO_eEKuNKan54AaABAg	0	0	2018-08-26 13:17:19	Adam Bram	Listening to Mr. Pena and reading many of the comments here reveals the two biggest challenges that climate sciences face -- ignorance and cognitive dissonance. Many intelligent people cling to disproven arguments that support their belief that climate change isn&#39;t human-caused, isn&#39;t dangerous, or isn&#39;t significant. The science on this is absolutely settled. Climate change IS happening. Climate change IS dangerous. Climate change IS significant. Every skeptical argument made is a hypothesis that has already been considered and researched by climate scientists. You can see the full list here: <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php">https://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php</a><br /><br />I am assuming some people reading this are reasonable and simply want to know the truth. The Dan Pena&#39;s of the world have their own agenda. Consider the argument that climate scientists are committing some sort of hoax for money. According to salary research, a climate scientist&#39;s salary is solidly placed in the middle-class income range. Mr. Pena, on the other hand, &quot;claims&quot; to have made billions from fossil fuels. If true, who exactly has the motivation to defraud the public? It isn&#39;t the middle-class climate scientists, who&#39;ve dedicated their lives to understanding this issue who are lying. It&#39;s people like Dan Pena.

From year to year it does vary in the spring and Autumn times but over the course of over 20 years now, there has been hardly any difference in sea levels rising to this very day and I can say with concrete evidence (literally) (just by looking at the concrete pillar of the barrier) there has been NO RISE IN SEA LEVEL as far as the eye can see OR MAYBE A COUPLE OF MILLIMETERS but even so that is so small that it&#39;s very miniscule. And as for the hot summer we had this year it wasn&#39;t quite like that of 1976 36deg not that I was around to enjoy it then, but in 2007 I did experience 38deg but thats because I was a coach driver in the middle of the city and the things aircon was broke! 1995 the year I left school it&#39;s hottest was 35deg, this year 2018 35deg but with a prolonged heatwave nearly like 1976 or possibly on par with. Carbon dioxide is a plants aspiration food and oxygen is an animale aspiration. We produce carbon dioxide along with our vehicles and industry and like the 1600 odd coal fired powerplants that are being planned to be built in China. Pure oxygen would actually kill you and the same with Co2. In the natural world all the Co2 that is produced by us is roughly 30 gigatons as compared to nature globally of 440 gigatons and then 450 gigatons is absorbed back again. Americans are now planting 1.6 billion new trees each year and are aiming to plant 5 new trees for each o e they cut down. Carbon Monoxide is a poisonous invisible gas which is why cars have catalytic converters to convert the CO to water which is why you see steam or sometimes water dripping from the tail pipe. About 21% of our air is oxygen.	UC9JJ0EMIkWjg2HOO6MipulQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9JJ0EMIkWjg2HOO6MipulQ	0

However, GSM has nothing to do with what is going on here: the signs are related to measures associated with the sun (I don’t pretend to know how they know: just passing it along). Anybody talking about GSM AND global warming is weird: other than some papers throwing in gratuitous mentions of AGW just cuz it helps the gravy! 🤪 When we can start measuring what GSM is doing on earth, we may already be f’d!!! Especially if we listen to the climascam frauds and start taking down our power systems and ability to extract fuels without a REAL replacement like nuclear. The scary thing is that the bad times may actually be far more abrupt: obviously ice ages take centuries to build up glaciers : but before then you’re talking extremely short summers- if food cannot grow fast enough, mass starvation may take out people long before the permafrost does	UCi8GKaAT_S8dMNwB2ItltKw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8GKaAT_S8dMNwB2ItltKw	1	UgxD7bX9KYIVnoSFOOV4AaABAg	Cody

I just caught a note from a cult member about the last two years at the poles ... completely ignoring all the stupid predictions of ‘no ice’ we been hearing for decades ... but the low ice buildup lines up with solar cycles. Now however, the ice is increasing dramatically, exactly as it should. I think your conspiracy theory is goofy, btw ... you believe pols are that clever AND quiet?!? Yeaaaaahhh -NO! Although I believe that they ARE that despicable. Go look up some videos on the Grand Solar Minimum... a lot of stuff is aligning on us being DAMN close to a very bad time. Trust me : we can deal with hot, if it goes cold then we are very SCREWED.

The Western countries are hampering the development of other Third World countries through imposition of energy laws. My country Nigeria has one of the highest coal deposit in the world. We cannot utilise it due to UN restriction. Infact our government recently expressed frustration over this restriction.. The western world utilised theirs a long time ago for their development. Why can't African nations do likewise now. It's unfair. Newer energy source are very expensive. Energy availability has always been a problem in Africa.

However, this does not necessarily disprove climate change. It more-so correlates to my sort of conspiracy theory, which i mentioned in my previous comment, as a way of generating more confusion around the topic, as well as succeding in polarizing some people.(Theoretically speaking)	UCMJqKFqabbeYtZYx-NCmn0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMJqKFqabbeYtZYx-NCmn0Q	1	UgxD7bX9KYIVnoSFOOV4AaABAg	Cody

I have this feeling that there is people like Al Gore with a vested interest in saying that the globe is warming and then there is groups like big oil that want to see no change. Its interesting my country has large reserves of black coal but we are told we can use them for our own residents and industry but are quite happy to sell it to growing economies.. What is your theory on the experts saying there was global cooling. The reason i bring it up is because it may indicate they were wrong then and they could be wrong now.

Naturally it has happened before because of an anomally like volcanic activity, this time its human activity. I dont care whether its called climate change or global warming or whatever name they may come up for it, it is still a very real phenomenon. Now its existence does not necesserally mean that there is no tax/big fraud connected to it! P.S- I have a theory about it, please dont take it as my point, just as an interesting thought. It is quite possible that the goverment and organizations are trying to polarize the population into two factions (for and against climate change), by creating SOME purposefully misleading/false studies. That would be beneficial to them because one group would support more industries and energy production(more money) and the other will support more taxation (more money). But i have no concrete evidence to support it.	UCMJqKFqabbeYtZYx-NCmn0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMJqKFqabbeYtZYx-NCmn0Q	1	UgxD7bX9KYIVnoSFOOV4AaABAg	Cody

One thing i no is the climatologists said it was global cooling in the 70s 80s then they said global warming until the figures did not back up there claims now its just called climate change which is what the climate does anyway..

Everything gets hotter in the photon bands, I think the stars put out more heat which warms the planets. The warming period causes food production issues with crops and surface ocean life (probably natural disasters too ) which effects the tax dollar in all nations so they have the CT program during the heating cycle. The materials released are expanded monoatomic metal atoms that all have large enough gravity fields to resist the earths gravity for a while, the particles come back down just slower	UCrDRAesv85y3GxxZlRkDd5w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrDRAesv85y3GxxZlRkDd5w	0

They reveal meta-truths, or condensed truth that aren’t factually true in that they happened, but truth as in if you do x, y is 90% chance of happening. Take all of the greatest literature, or just Shakespeare’s work alone, higher or meta truths are revealed and that is why they’re compelling and praised over time. Intelligence and curiosity is needed so only these types are interested and the rest remain sceptical. Until you read enough of theses books, you don’t understand the truth they convey.

Wikipedia, &quot;The mercury-in-glass or mercury thermometer was invented by physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in Amsterdam (1714).&quot; &quot;The modern thermometer gradually evolved from the thermoscope with the addition of a scale in the early 17th century and standardisation through the 17th and 18th centuries.&quot; Amsterdam the Netherlands Northern Europe so most of the most reliable temperature readings from the 17 to 1800s come from northern Europe and the North sea COLD AREAS. Then the modern thermometer spreads worldwide through Europe and North America, temperate climates, then through the world with Britain&#39;s domination of the world in temperate and tropical regions, and then today&#39;s new cities in deserts and tropical regions that are very hot but made livable by modern efficient air conditioning and dehumidifiers.

So they get the Earth&#39;s average temp simply by adding up all the thermometers from universities and Earth research stations world wide, now very recently satellites. When they compare today&#39;s data to the past averaged in this way they are comparing a world wide temperature today, to thermometers from all over the temperate and colder regions, plus many new cities in the tropics and desert regions. Then a little further back they compare to temps in only the West which is almost exclusively in temperate and colder regions. The rise in temperatures is created by mankind in possession of thermometers population growth into deserts and tropical regions that are very hot but now liveable because of modern efficient refrigeration and air conditioning.

So the more co2 in the atmosphere the more plants wich = more oxygen. A perfect system, untill you start messing with geoenginerring (man made machines and techniques tomodify our weather, look it up. Us gov openly admits to its research/developments and use.)

Ugw4QAAmCKBUDBmjJxR4AaABAg	0	0	2018-08-20 00:28:26	Nostrudoomus	GIVE ME A BREAK, the so called temperature rise, &quot;climate change, is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth&#39;s climate system&quot;, is total nonsense. In recent years and current population growth all new cities have been built in hotter places than in the past BECAUSE BETTER AIR CONDITIONING AND REFRIGERATION allows building where land is cheap! The reason for the temperature rise is because in the recent past years and currently the vast majority of the Earth&#39;s population growth have built new cities in long existing deserts and tropical regions that have never been so heavily populated in the past. This means that all the new thermometers come from AREAS THAT ARE NATURALLY HOTTER than where mankind has lived in the past, so when they add together world wide average temperatures the calculation includes a large number of new areas that are naturally hotter and may have been even hotter before, but THE TEMPERATURE HAS NOT CHANGED AT ALL what has changed is that mankind has moved to hotter places.

This man made climate crap will go down as the biggest globalist hoax/scam since the 2008 recession.

It was never about Florida. <br /><br />That was just something to spread around to get the people who wasted their vote on that sack of shit to whine about because if you can dupe someone once then you can keep duping them right? The modus operandi of leftist politics. <br /><br />But onto climate change. If climate change is real that means the earth&#39;s temperatures are rising and if the earth&#39;s temperature is rising that means that lichens, grasses, shrubs and trees will grow more abundantly which means that those living things will eat up carbon dioxide and produce more oxygen. <br /><br />Yes, kids, that&#39;s right. Even if climate change is real the green house naughty gas will be eaten up by more lichens, grasses, shrubs and trees and everything will balance out again. That&#39;s based upon observable repeatable science no thanks to Al Gore I might add. <br /><br />Al Gore is full of shit because that means the naughty green house gas that libturds often whine about will be eaten up and more oxygen will be produced thus eliminating the hoax of climate change because their naughty gas won&#39;t kill us all thus foiling their plan for more government control over every aspect of your life in order to save you from yourself.

It&#39;s always right-wing Republicans because they are social lemmings without a clue about the science. There is too much arrogant ignorance to argue with here. The only reason Earth isn&#39;t a ball of ice is because CO2 traps heat and keeps us warm. In the last 150 years we have increased CO2 by half and that is making Earth much warmer. That&#39;s just simple physics. There have been thousands of studies globally by thousands of scientists and their research supports the same conclusions. They are in agreement. We are making this planet increasingly inhospitable for us. Adding energy to any system makes it more volatile. Think of it like a cake mix or fuel for a car. If you mess with the mixture and turn up the heat you&#39;ll get a different and less desirable result.	UCsZDCjnkMTO-jEO9PJaa6tQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsZDCjnkMTO-jEO9PJaa6tQ	0

Thyen 3.5 billion years ago, cyanobacteria grew in massive numbers in the form of stromatilites and ate up the CO2, creating an oxygen rich world, allowing all other living things to grow and to survive.<br /><br /> Life on earth has arisen about 5 times.<br /><br /> We are not talking about then, we didn&#39;t exist in those times. We have only existed for the last 300,000 years, approximately.<br /><br /> Up until 12 or 14 thousand years ago, our planet was in a period of glaciation, an ice age.<br /> Then things started to warm up about 12 thousand years ago.<br /> It warmed up enough for the great ice masses to melt creating the Black Sea, and raising the sea level enough for Australia to become separated from the Papua New Guinea land mass and for a very deep straight to form and seperated the island of Tasmania from mainland Australia.<br /><br /> THAT was global warming and it is still warming up today.<br /><br />There was a respite in the 1300s when global temperatures dropped about 2 to 3 degrees and about 50 million people died as a result. Crops failed and diseases spread all over the world.<br /> But then in the 1800s the temperature started to rise again.<br />Global warming kicked in again.<br /><br /> Global warming is a natural fact.<br /> How much human activity has on it all IS debatable.<br />But global warming IS a fact.

The atmosphere is so thin that compared to a desk globe, the atmosphere would be the thickness of the lacquer finish. It's so thin you can just walk up to where you can't breath. Have you heard of the great Dust Bowl in the US in the 1930s? That massive natural disaster that covered most of the US was just from a few decades of poor farming techniques. Yes, there would have been a drought anyway but the dust made it vastly worse and last longer. We are pumping billions of tons of GHG every year. We have increase the chemical that regulates temperature by half. Physics informs us that that is changing the planet. We are causing a mass extinction event. How is that not changing the planet?

However, the reason it has become such a huge industry is due to other individuals like Pena,; enterprising people that have seen opportunity to make money from the earth&#39;s misfortune. Scientific data does not lie. It has been peer reviewed , and an overwhelming consensus agreed upon by all of the world&#39;s leading science and climate institutions.

That&#39;s an indication of not being educated in the scientific method and be ready to accept any kind of hypothesis from an authority figure. <br /><br />The hypothesis of the alarmists is that human activity is the predominant factor for climate change (that, suspiciously, used to be &quot;global warming&quot;).Guess what! That hasn&#39;t been proven to any degree. Yes, we do cause some change in our environment, but how much and what we can do about it, are questions that CAN&#39;T BE ANSWERED for climate is a very INSENSITIVE and CHAOTIC system. <br /><br />I have watched hundreds of hours of experts talking in conferences for the climate and the sceptics have the most scientific position. It&#39;s the &quot;WE DON&#39;T KNOW&quot; position. The alarmists say &quot;WE DO KNOW AND IT&#39;S US&quot; and proceed into trying to prove this statement and fall on their faces with every climate prediction model they devise (statistical significance close to ZERO). <br /><br />Of course the latter are a bunch of scientists that are government funded and build a career around this state funding. The state needs to promote this agenda in order to tax the populous in various ways. The sceptics, on the contrary, have nothing to gain besides the fact that they want the truth to be known. <br /><br />Even the 97% consensus proved to be, in practicality, a less than 4% consensus that was boosted by INCLUDING MOST OF THE SCEPTICS who come up and protest about it. But it is people like you that regurgitate the alarmist agenda without bothering to look into the details. Pitty, for the devil is on the details.

With the holy angels, and the redeemed from every age, Jesus leaves the Earth in utter desolation for a thousand years.

He is picking and choosing the statistics that he wants to support his pre conceived opinion. Human made climate change is real. Its based on all on the super rapid change of temperature we are seeing. Its never been about the highest temp we have seen through ice cores. There is still 1 question that no climate change denier can answer... If you are right, and we spend billions on a renewable energy, nothing changes but we will have an unlimited energy source... But you if you are wrong and we dont bother, what then? how horrific will the 50 years be for our kids on this planet because we played the dice?

High Co2 would also increase Oxygen levels...besides the equation they use, they dont add everything that emits co2 in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere.. is there a problem? it seems that way.. But the likelyhood that co2 is causing it is so low its basically non-existent... Theres more evidence that nano- particulates like aluminum are more likely to creat the conditions we see, than CO2... and that actually has evidence to back it up.. Ground soil and water have tested positive for aluminum 1000x higher than what it should be... Aluminum raises ground ph.. and if PH goes over or under 7, plants cant retain certain minerals and viable nutrients... It turns in on itself and self destructs, and were seeing alot of that around the country and world in general.. High aluminum levels in the atmosphere would also cause drought and various dramatic conditions that were actually seeing right now... Its not us... Its something being used to screw over our food production. and the farming industry... but monsanto has Drought & aluminum resistant Seeds for us.. How nice of them.. Wonder how they knew the ground would be polluted with alumin..	UCU-VW_QOFT_yl9AyRGsw9Pg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-VW_QOFT_yl9AyRGsw9Pg	1	Ugy3QXUtrlT8WFnAhhl4AaABAg	thelongs27

I think) The problem with CO2 pollution is that it makes all plants grow well ......... Everyone knows when plants increase, so does the number of weeds. Maybe democrats could find a use of the excessive weeds that will be generated. Maxine Waters could head up the weed committee and skim enough to build herself another $ 6 Million house for her public service. Democrats could have their own weed company pet project like Obama did. Remember Solendra...... Democrats could call this company that they slip taxpayer money to..... Weedendra. Climate change will almost likely lead to bumper crops that our world has never seen before, crippling child hunger and possibly all world hunger. Acute storage issues for surpluses of grain could also be a foreseeable problem. Government subsidies for additional grain elevators could be another Democrat demand for more taxation and spending. Maxine could probably build yet another home in Venezuela from the money she skims from grain elevator companies like Grainoendra. Don't be a Climate Change Bumper Crop "Denier". There are more Democrat scandals to be had. This would be a great project and admittedly best handled on the democrat plantation.

I have suspected for a long time now that the &quot;global warming&quot; is a total scam. In fact as a result of no appreciable warming this century, slowly it is now called &quot;climate change&quot;. Supposedly the extra heat being produced is now going into the sea. Somehow this was not happening before. What a load of hogwash. Couple this with carbon taxes and the manipulation of global temperatures, it all smells very much of a scam. Dan, you rock. Keep at them!!!	UCZgNJ-nLlYxtg5cPnBogtaw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZgNJ-nLlYxtg5cPnBogtaw	0

When mankind burns fossil fuels. those were all once living things that sequestered huge amounts of CO2 that were in the environment at that time. The alarmist about global warming never seem to give any thought to the possibility that the increasing the CO2 may actually be restorative to the planet and be returning it to an incredibly more productive period. There is an incredible amount of unused and potentially incredibley fertile land currently frozen that could come into cultivation that could feed incredible numbers of people. That would be good, not catastrophic as the alarmist all seem to focus on. They don&#39;t have a crystal ball and are totally clueless even IF they are right about the warming. It may only be temporary until the global plant production increases and uses the new supply of CO2 to also increase the oxygen supply along with the food supply.

Even so, with or without a huge spike, a small one still can have a lot of negative effects. I would prefer to keep political and monetary changes related to the topic aside from the main arguments and to have a more scientific or to say realistic way of looking at it. By this I mean if we want to avoid having a pointless talk about who said what, we should use peer-reviewed studies on climate change. And to reach an agreement we either confirm or proove them otherwise. However, knowing myself and the typical internet user we'll be too lazy to do so. So atleast thanks for responding and have a nice day.	UCMJqKFqabbeYtZYx-NCmn0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMJqKFqabbeYtZYx-NCmn0Q	1	UgxGFeAZQRs5PMdFFyh4AaABAg	MrJoecool9999

Also records clearly show that CO2 increases in the atmosphere follow increases in global temperatures - outgassing - SO - simple logic would tell you that CO2 increases are a product of Global warming not the cause....! A Climate scientist in Ireland recently stated that - "The last time we had CO2 levels this high - sea levels were 25ft higher than they are now....!" - now this is a typical example of the type of scientist who supports the Alarmist agenda - he makes a statement which actually provides evidence which refutes his own premise - yet uses it because the entire fraud is being sold to the public by instilling Fear....! This is a conforming scientist - who are the only scientists who are supporting this agenda.....! Real scientists are ignored and largely unheard on this issue - simply because the same Globalists who own this agenda also own the MSM.....!

Plus the physics behind CO2 as a greenhouse gas. If you want to convince anybody that climate change is a big fraud you first have to name anddispruve the oposing evidence and propose the potential reasons of the fraud( of which i am aware but still critical)	UCMJqKFqabbeYtZYx-NCmn0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMJqKFqabbeYtZYx-NCmn0Q	1	UgxGFeAZQRs5PMdFFyh4AaABAg	MrJoecool9999

Try pulling your head out of your ass, put your 'Big Boy' panties on, MAN UP and you'll see that Democrats are the only party who actually care about the Constitution and the Law in this country as all Trump does is BREAK the Laws of our country with his phony 'emergency' that he said 'I didn't have to do this", declaring it a NON-emergency, he's so fucking stupid, he BURIES himself on a perpetual basis by exposing his own lies.

Also, all the volcanoes that have erupted, we should get into a time machine and cap them off so they never erupted. Also, to remind you: those who said "the world is ROUND" were also mocked as STUPID. Those who said "The EARTH revolves around the SUN!" were also "Suicidal stupidity". Now, there are those who have been arguing for CENTURIES about God. It will NEVER end. Just as both sides of the "global warming" camp will argue until eternity. Let's view this from a Philosophy standpoint: Humans are a product of nature, therefore, their pollution is NATURAL. (I'm sure that pisses you off to NO END, but I'm just the messenger - feel free to go to Princeton University and argue that with the Professors there.)

You realize that the money that they do receive on carbon taxes in places that have them mainly goes to their pocket right? While the rest just goes back into spreading their agenda. If said carbon taxes where actually designed to help lower carbon emissions then instead of using that money to fuel their agenda. They would instead use that money at for subsidies for solar panels and electric vehicles. And no, I'm not talking about investing in electric vehicle companies, or investing in solar panel companies. I'm talking about giving that money back to the populace as subsidies, so they can purchase said solar panels or electric vehicles.

(As is generally the case, neollib Democrats "conveniently" are able to vote "No" in a rightie Congress--if necessary instead, a sufficient number would have voted "Yes.") You might someday note that this happened often through many previous decades. If it's not tax cuts, it's war: Johnson's Vietnam War surtax, for example. (I remember my father bitching wildly about that--rightfully so.) Get it?! We tire of debating and endlessly parsing the self-evident with you. Please shift at least some of the blame where it rightfully belongs. You refuse to acknowledge the "puppeteers" pulling stings behind the scenes--mostly from the right, but also from the left. You believe still that that's OK?: (After all, you do actually get a kick that it harms the left, correct!?) Then stop bitching! OK, guys: It's taken a long while finally to realize how this actually works. Both the traditional left and right have changed massively--for the worse. Note our massive, yet steadily shrinking streams of $--funneling inexorably upward. (I'm thinking now of Walmart. It's gotten to the point where we must acquiesce--since it's far cheaper--even it's brazen upstart $tree nowadays, too. That won't last indefinitely.--yes, that likewise massive stream of container ships to our ports need not continue into perpetuity, given future lack of ability to purchase. Welcome then to dirt floors, akin to those of Mexico and India.....)	UCtvYc-FrT2ZDyjROua8rgOQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtvYc-FrT2ZDyjROua8rgOQ	1	UgwaC4CV99FFDZ8Wc5B4AaABAg	UTSB

The real truth is that they are essentially one part in ideology as well as practically electorally. There is only the Democratic Republican Dictatorship Party. There are not free and open elections in the USA and the vast majority of people are prohibited from voting since it isn't really voting if you are legally prohibited for voting for the party you want to vote for.

I enjoy science, I have studied a relatively broad range of science at university level and I regularly listen to science podcasts and read plenty too. Can you explain to me how going to an automobile race track will be especially helpful in understanding science, in particular climate science?

If you've ever had somebody 'borrow' something off of you while swearing they will give it back, but they never do because they forgot about you? Our scientific community is controlled by those types of people. I am a drop-out that can pick up on languages, rebuild/repair almost anything mechanical and know some interesting cards that work for the companies that we see making the news when space ships conquer our gravitational pull. My best advice for you? Go to your local automobile race track on a Friday night and wander into the pits. You will meet actual geniuses and complete madmen that will answer any question, know most things, tell you a crazy story and probably feed you if you give them help. I wish you the best as the smell of race gas and burnt tires wafting through the air gives you a charge like no other and I am not one to shape opinions that you can draw for yourself. Plan on spending $27 to have the experiences I have had in this short, over taxed life. Cheers. Or watch 'Two Lane Blacktop'.

Not looking for any "gotcha" moments, just keen to understand. My first question, in no particular order: would your concern regarding the loss of freedoms be different if you believed the claims of science regarding human contribution to warming? It's just that I believe the science so the freedoms argument is not really as relevant from my perspective. I think we are likely to make more headway if we talk about why the science is likely to be false. In fact, talking about the science itself is probably not helpful based on the relative scientific ignorance of the majority of us (obviously, I'm unaware of the extent of your science education). How are they wrong about the science, and/or misleading the public? How are they fooling so many? How do so many scientifically illiterate people justify siding with the minority?

The Dutch used to use New York Harbor as a trade route when it iced over anually until about 1642. Think about how many regulations were popping off back in New Amsterdam then with their lax technology. Shucks, this is tiresome to point out the fact that your time equals your wealth, which is in concert with how most measure life. Say you spent 5,000 years making money to basically survive, but you also spent 2,500 of those years just offering your work and time to an entity that told you they know how to spend your time better than you do. Now imagine that you only have 50 good years and let it sink in for a minute. Wonder why the middle class is disappearing? They are getting taxed out of existence. High skilled workers are traded for low quality comfort. Et cetera,et cetera,et cetera. As long as nobody's fucking feelings get hurt, I guess it is O-FUCKING-K? Bad words lead to starvation and mortal wounds these days according to the moral arbiters calling out for the very thing that puts us all, without majority conscience, one step away from a cliff dive that we cannot come back from without a major societal collapse. Be wary. Everything you term to love could be lost.	UCE0CzQqAddgQdYBbQKMQ2bA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE0CzQqAddgQdYBbQKMQ2bA	1	Ugw_eXhLkCZ1kSvLYFd4AaABAg	The Fiasco Garage

Your story about a glaciologist, as I'm sure you are aware, is not particularly strong evidence of a climate change hoax/ conspiracy but it doesn't hurt. Unfortunately, Robert Swan, Michael Palin and Ranulph Fiennes have been to both poles and have also "bitched" plenty about climate change.(A couple have also bitched a little extra about Trump) Again, this really says nothing of the evidence for or against climate change but it does cast a little extra doubt regarding the accuracy and/or honesty of Pena's claims. It only took me a few minutes on Google to find these three guys (Michael Palin is also relatively well known as one of the British Monty Python team). Is it a little hard to believe he made an honest error or do you think he was happy to bend the truth significantly to entertain (He certainly has plenty of, what some would call, charisma!)? Do you think he might have embelished some of his other claims(on a second listen some sounded a bit sketchy) or was the last couple of minutes a one off? Hopefully not too many others re-tell his "bipolar" story they might get shot down by someone who loves old British comedy.

I'm nowhere near a genius, but I try to make sense of the world around us and do not often believe certain sources of information when there are mass amounts of variables that have yet to even be proven true but are told as fact. I'm not even sure that Paraffins consist of the aged biological matter that we call "Dinosaur Juice". Realistically, I believe oil comes from a certain type of bacteria. Case en pointe is how they use a bacteria called Bacillus Thuringiensis to clean up oil spills in water. Think about that for a minute. The oldest proven life forms and even what we've found from meteors have evidence of bacteria. And we live with them every day, with decomposition aside there still has to be biological material hundreds of feet below us that somehow got locked in perfect pockets all over the world without adding mass to a planet that sustains intelligent life? We are purposely mis-informed to stay subservient it seems. Some of us have the grit to question it, others will try to knock us back in step like the good slaves they know we can be.

There's a lot of methane hydrate frozen in the artic, just waiting to bubble up through the permafrost and greatly add to global warming. Once the Greenland ice sheets melt your looking at 6 meters of sea level rise. Once Antartica really starts to melt your looking at another 90 meters of sea level rise. But, people won't really worry about global warming until fish are swimming in their living rooms. Then everyone will be complaining about government policy. When it's to late.

There have been a minimum of 6 ice ages before the dawn of man. We can stop burning every fossil fuel, bio-fuel, jet fuel etc today for eternity and not a damn thing will change. What the ice core samples have taught us is that the temperatures have raised and dropped, along with Co2 levels, again long before mankind. China is the biggest deceiver on earth with the US media coming in a close second. The Paris accords were completely voluntary with absolutely no oversight or inspections, meaning its members can say whatever the hell they want with no proof. You seem to ignore the fact that China’s number 1 goal is world dominance. Period. They are strategically vying for this role in so many ways, now the political move of claiming to lead the green revolution is absolutely hilarious. Do you think a nation who treats it’s inhabitants like stock yard animals gives a shit about the environment? These are people who pollute their own country at such a historic rate that just breathing the air will kill you faster. They poison their own food through the worst processing standards of any developed nation. They are communists for fuck sake, and purposefully killed more of their own citizens than any other nation in human history. So go on and believe the line the media tells you, that it is up to us to set our economy back (while by the way, ramping up pollution through the manufacturing of toxic products in electric power production) before all of human kind is destroyed. And let’s become more like China by giving all power to our government and trust them to regulate our lives since of course they will have the future of the human race at heart. We need to get rid of plastics. Save the oceans through sustainable fisheries and develop filtration technology to clean the waters. We can not alter the coming temperature change of the earth. It used to be colder, and it used to be warmer. You know how they find saber tooth and wolly mammoth fossils in the most desolate places in Siberia in ice 10 feet below ground? That’s because it was once not ice. Those animals thrived in much warmer environments with higher Co2 levels. Some of this stuff you don’t need to be a scientist to figure out. They all get their funding from the same places, and they are broke as shit without it. Once again, it’s all about $. Look at AOC, just came up with the green new deal, the most radical, expensive, life altering agenda. All in the name of “climate change”.

That's a difficult question to answer, like, really difficult. Where does it come from? The creation of crude oil is an abiogenic process... The 'fossil fuels' thing is nonsense, everything that is organic decays and gets processed by fungi, bacteria and detritivore insects. Organic matter does not decompose and then through some magical process turn into an inorganic product (petroleum) over millions of years. All humans already know what happens when something decays, we actively work to try and prevent decomposition of organic matter - we embalm our dead, preserve and refrigerate our food, and we treat our building materials. All organic material follows a life cycle, it grows, it dies, it decomposes and gets consumed by fungi, insects and bacteria which produce waste products that are the building blocks of life. Nowhere in that cycle can something turn to petroleum, even if it were feasible over millions of years, what is preserving this life from decay for millions of years to allow it to transform into an inorganic material? We also know petroleum is inorganic because anything made out of petroleum (plastics essentially) take millions of years to break down. Fun fact, biodegradable plastics aren't made of petroleum, they're made of plant products, usually, cellulose or they're synthetic. Oil is made in a similar way to diamonds... Lots of heat and pressure. The earth is a 99% closed loop system. Everything on earth has to be recycled in one way or another, the only input on planet earth is heat/solar energy from the sun. If oil were predominately or entirely a process of organic matter decay into 'inorganic' crude oil, with no conversion from crude oil back to organic matter to grow new life, then the process of oil formation would slowly remove organic matter from the closed system that is the planet earth over billions of years until earth has no organic matter left and simply massive stores of oil, no? So how does oil actually form then? Well, this is basic chemistry, oil is hydrocarbons with a tonne of impurities (sulphur, lead, iron, stuff like that) and hydrocarbons are as they sound chains of hydrogen and carbon. Essentially you need to put hydrogen and carbon into the equation and somehow get a chemical reaction which results in hydrocarbons, which is petroleum oil or alcohols, out the other end. What things are in plentiful supply in the closed loop system of the earth which contain hydrogen, carbon, or both and which could be super pressurized and heated somewhere in the earth? Well, we could CO2 and H2 in the mantle, that's super hot and creates massive pressure, that would create natural gas (CH4) and water (H20)... That would be a hell of a lot more likely than decaying but somehow not decaying animal and plant products. I mean, I get why you'd think otherwise, we were all raised to think oil was decomposed life... Or nondecomposed life... Or organic matter than somehow transformed into inorganic matter, or whatever... But it's like a lot of the things in life, just because it's what we've been taught, doesn't mean it's right.

I could throw all the facts, data, climate models, secret emails and classified documents I like at you but if your friends are brainless liberals then it will make zero difference... They won't ever follow the facts, they'll only ever follow their feelings, that is what truly divides people between left and right. Sure there's some crossover because nobody fits in a box, but in general, people who appeal to emotions fall left and people who appeal to data fall right. Your liberal go green friends will NEVER believe you that green energy is killing the planet, that nuclear is the safest option that we have, that climate change is BS and we have enough fossil fuels for at least a few more centuries BECAUSE they won't appeal to facts and data - they're now convinced that these things are evil and to convince them otherwise would take counter brainwashing with new propaganda... The left only learns through brainwashing and propaganda. That said, how do you convince these friends that SWEAR (probably on their life) that we only have currently 30 years and 6 months left of fossil fuels (seeing as I'm replying 6 months after you posted)? You don't, you will never convince them that they're wrong, with the left emotions and propaganda always trump facts and data. Ask them 'so what?' Tell them it doesn't matter. If they're right and we really only have another 29 years and 6 months of fossil fuels left, then they can get the jump on the solar and wind game before 'climate/oil deniers.' Tell them 'so what, if fossil fuels are bad and they're killing the planet, they'll be entirely depleted in 30 years. Then what? So we'll have a major energy crisis because the last drop of the bloodline that runs human society has been exhausted but we won't have even a single ounce of oil left to burn and we'll have to all convert over to solar or wind anyway.' If they truly believe oil will run out in 30 years then they shouldn't be alarmed, they should be happy, we'd have no choice but to switch over to solar and wind. So then you ask them... Do you REALLY believe we'll run out of fossil fuels in 30 years? Do you REALLY believe fossil fuels are this catastrophically evil thing? The way they're framing it 'peak oil' and the burning of every last drop of oil is a win-win game for green liberals.

Think algae and plankton in oceans and lakes dying and becoming sediment on the bottom, then getting buried under more sediment, so on and so forth over a ridiculous time scale. They call them fossil fuels because they are derived from these extremely long term processes, just like fossils are bones that converted into rock over an extremely long time scale. The idea that fossil fuels are literally dead dinosaurs is incorrect.	UCSdER8czpl0D7EIXhjlo_eQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSdER8czpl0D7EIXhjlo_eQ	1	UgyJBbAx9jHvEdzfgid4AaABAg	Mike Whipkey

The earth is a living organism THAT PRODUCES WASTE like every other organic system. Oil is a secretion of the earth that is produced because, like the man said, it’s bombarded with more energy than it consumes from the sun. So, just like us, the excess energy we take in is either stored (as oil is in the earth) or excreted, or both.

(no obstacles)* The companies who participate in this scheme would get this "government"'s support, exclusivities, contracts, etc... ensuring their business's future.

I’m NOT saying that you’re wrong; I’m saying that if you’re not open to that POSSIBILITY, then TRUTH is not relevant to you and your arguments are without merit. I would recommend an ‘agenda-less’ media source like National Geographic or the like. Why anybody would accept, as fact, the word of someone who admittedly has a self-interest in the issue (like the buffoon in this video), is beyond comprehension.

Science should be open-minded, and impartial to any possible truth; Sadly, the second a scientist shows doubts or disagreement with an overly-promoted theory _(let's say, darwinian evolution),_ he suddenly becomes discredited, booed, and risk losing his job. People put more faith in their current understanding of Science _(which is always in motion)_ than they would like to admit... to the point where the fallacies actually come from themselves, and not from the religious. Science indeed became the new religion: If we doubt a theory, we are branded heretics, and persecuted by so-called Atheists. The saddest thing in all this; most of these atheists don't even understand what they became. Regarding the Bible, I agree that we should look further _(and impartially)_ in its archaeological claims. _(especially for the most farfetched events)_ This would be the best way for unbelievers to at least consider its credibility. In any case, the Bible is THE best document in history, in my opinion.	UCYYwkYqo67FmGZ5aNhVbtKg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYwkYqo67FmGZ5aNhVbtKg	1	UgzCVVODDIQnuB_harB4AaABAg	Verum

Entire world yes he conquered many kingdom's but had shortcomings not recorded because he wanted to be remembered as a God king every man has faults and made mistakes except the son of man who was GOD in the flesh hence another reason the huge significance of the gospel salvation and lessons of do's and don't to keep us from harm and repeatable offenses to our father adonai to keep us from being turned over to the tormentors God bless	UCOEAL1MPeur0m3cbTzDWMIA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOEAL1MPeur0m3cbTzDWMIA	1	UgzCVVODDIQnuB_harB4AaABAg	Verum

Since then, and due to these current changes, heat is picked up from the south, and transported to the north, and vice versa, *directly affecting climate.* Pilots then experience more turbulence, rendering air travel a bit more difficult. THIS, is most likely what you're experiencing, and it has NOTHING to do with man. Sadly, some use such event to push for modern (and francly, evil) ideologies, you'd be the gullible one to follow everything they say out of faith in their "professionalism".

The glaciers have all started melting if not already fully melted at an extraordinarily fast rate. The permafrost is melting in Siberia faster each year. Mongolian nomads are loosing all their livestock because of droughts &amp; the summers are longer &amp; winters are hotter &amp; shorter. All the wildfires, droughts &amp; floods are a clear sign of our impact on the planets temperature.

High Co2 would also increase Oxygen levels...besides the equation they use, they dont add everything that emits co2 in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere.. is there a problem? it seems that way.. But the likelyhood that co2 is causing it is so low its basically non-existent... Theres more evidence that nano- particulates like aluminum are more likely to creat the conditions we see, than CO2... and that actually has evidence to back it up.. Ground soil and water have tested positive for aluminum 1000x higher than what it should be... Aluminum raises ground ph.. and if PH goes over or under 7, plants cant retain certain minerals and viable nutrients... It turns in on itself and self destructs, and were seeing alot of that around the country and world in general.. High aluminum levels in the atmosphere would also cause drought and various dramatic conditions that were actually seeing right now...

When I started teaching in 1979, immanent Ice Age was being reported by national geographic and Time magazine as well as in other journals. Then the focus changed to how much deodorant kiwis, kangaroos and penguins were using thereby putting a hole in the ozone layer. Then it was global warming and now climate change. Of course Hollywood got creative and stitched the narratives of new Ice age to global warming via the block buster, the day after tomorrow. I.e global warming causes a snap Ice age. And let&#39;s not forget all the other hyperbolic scare campaigns such as SARs, swine flu, avian flu etc etc. Chicken little, &quot;the sky is falling, the sky is falling!&quot; Btw, was Michael Crichton assassinated for his exposure of the globalist scam?

So where theres a question its been settled and there is agreement of scientists that its settled. This isnt a conspiracy or anything its just how the scientific peer review process works. So this same process applies to gravity, the law of thermodynamics and evolution. So its basically saying its a fact." Scientific "sense" or logic? Hmmmm! So what point has the "data" reached, what exactly is the "data" and how does it differ from data found in the historical geologic record? What "scientists" agreed on the data? Are there scientists who disagree with the "data"? Why? What "peers" are included or excluded from the peer review process? Who determines the participants in the process? "Citing a scientific consensus isnt the same thing as an appeal to authority fallacy. An appeal to authority is when you say something is true simply because an authority said it. But thats not why a scientific fact is true because scientists say so. If I say "my doctor says that drug causes headaches" thats not an appeal to authority." Of course it's not but why cite something you don't appeal to? I take it you have accepted the "man-made global warming theory" as fact. A theory is not a fact, it's a theory! You stated, "This current warming period however is caused by humans. There is a scientific consensus on it." So clarify your position. From whom did you base your conclusion that "this current warming period is caused by humans"? Is this a quote? Or is it from your own research or the data, research and opinions of others you see as authorities on the issue? "Also there wasnt a scientific consensus on flat earth it was just a laymans belief." This was just an example to highlight the problem of "consensus". "Consensus" (however you define it) in general terms, scientific, political, social or anything else very often lead to false conclusions, resulting in a "sheep herd mentality". I take it you believe that science is pure and never influenced by politics?	UCpy79xCD-P6AqX8eMuRYo-w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpy79xCD-P6AqX8eMuRYo-w	1	UgyJ7Q7TzD2GphiRiI94AaABAg	heruartist71

Do you mean "accepted theories by those who have the power to propagate and enforce them"? Also a "consensus" doesn't necessarily mean truth! If you ever have taken a college logic class, you will know this is called Appealing to Authority Fallacy. There used to be a "consensus" that the world was flat and you would fall of the edge if you got too close, which was the accepted "common knowledge" in midieval Europe. "Science" is very political which skews knowledge. So if you peel back the cover and reveal the political agenda behind "global warming", you will better understand why this issue has been shaped as human created rather than a natural cycle of the Earth.

The models project a decrease of Antarctic sea ice, which is in contrast with observations." Lars Kaleschke, Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability at the University of Hamburg. Kaleschke has been there and researched the ice himself. The Antarctic Sea ice is the largest it has ever been since we have launched satellites to view it and he admits himself that it goes completely against the models projected by the Climate Change scientists. Climate change is a theory which needs to be supported by proofs but the proofs are just not there. The legislation that is being passed because of this theory is destroying the lives of civilians while making politicians extremely rich. We will never be able to have honest discourse and research pertaining to this issue as long as it is so politicized and has the advantage of making the worlds wealthiest people even wealthier.

There is not one iota of scientific evidence to support it---------ANYWHERE! I repeat---carbon dioxide is NOT a check valve. It is clear that you do not even know what that means.

Additionally: 1) What you describe is just one part of the greenhouse effect. Some solar radiation is absorbed by Earth's surface which then radiates heat in the form of infrared radiation. Some of that escapes the atmosphere but some is absorbed and radiated back towards Earth by the atmosphere. More greenhouses gasses such as CO2 amplify this effect. You have a myriad of scientifically sound methods to verify the veracity of the greenhouse effect, including small scale experiments as well as referencing any of the thousands of peer-reviewed scientific resources in existence. 2) CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere doesn't pool near the surface due to the dynamic nature of the planet. Temperature gradients and planetary motion among other factors contribute to an atmosphere that is in constant flux (think weather systems) which constantly distribute CO2 throughout the atmosphere and prevent Brownian motion from being the dominant factor in the mix of atmospheric fluids.

The way it allegedly works is the suns rays enter through the atmos-phere and then the "excess" heat is radiated harmlessly out into space. However, because of man's actions too much carbon dioxide is present in the UPPER atmosphere and instead of the so called "excess" heat being radiated out into space the heat "bounces" off the layer of carbon dioxide in the UPPER atmosphere and thereby raises the temperature of the earth. So immediately there are two enormous flaws with that "theory". 1). Why did the suns rays bounce off the carbon dioxide on the way in? As I said, carbon dioxide is NOT a check valve. If someone wants to say the sun bouncing off the earth hits the carbon dioxide and cannot get out then how did it getting inside the carbon dioxide layer in the first place? do you see the error there? 2). CArbon dioxide IS heavier than the air---meaning it SINKS down to ground level. Which is why all green plants do so well. They feed off carbon dioxide and give back oxygen. Everything about the man made global warming is a lie.	UC4mq8o7cxMuDSmg1XDeYaaA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mq8o7cxMuDSmg1XDeYaaA	1	UgweDONgLJrK7yIfur14AaABAg	george george

None one single global warming "theory" is based upon ANY empirical evidence of any kind. Every scrap of so called "evidence" produced by the global warming alarmists has been completely and scientifically discredited---also known as being caught redhanded in a lie. 4) The historical record pertaining to the recording of temperatures around the globe did not begin in earnest with anything resembling accurate science until recent history. There is less than 100 years of anything resembling accurate data. Even the temperature records of the lower 48 states has been compromised because the people who installed the sensors put 897 out of 1,000 of them in the exact wrong location! They installed them in places like black tar roof tops, asphalt parking lots, next to microwave emitter towers and waste water treatment digesters. This means, they placed 90% of those sensitive recording devices next to man made heat producing objects! 5) It is absolutely impossible, and thoroughly unscientific, to base future predictions about the climate patterns on a planet about five BILLION years old using nothing but compromised data collected from an instant in time--- which is what 100 years is compared to five billion years, especially when people use nothing but computer models to make a prediction----basically garbage in garbage out! 6) Everyone in the global warming community complete ignores the fact that the computer programming that resulted in the predictions forecast were all performed by global warming alarmists in the first place. In other words, they knew what data to put in to make the computer spit out exactly what they wanted. When socialists come out with outrageous claims and ask for extreme measures to be taken there is no such thing as "conflict of interest" or "compromised". Oh no, Socialists and their partners in the main stream media are as pure as the wind driven virgin snow. Funny how the mainstream media never goes near that bit of news. 7)The ice caps are growing not shrinking which has been thoroughly and scientifically PROVEN! 8) Icebergs are supposed to melt. They drift into warmer waters and melt as they have done for billions of years. 9) Man made global warming, a title recently altered to be known as "climate change", was invented/created out of thin air with NO scientific substantiation by the communist/socialist party. 10)There is no such thing as "fossil fuel". It is a deliberately misleading, manufactured term. Fossil fuel does not exist. 11) Buh Bye.

The fact that many scientists have come forward and blown enormous holes in the scam of man made global warming is evidence enough that there are honest scientists out there. The problem is socialists who control the main stream media, or people with empty heads like you who blindly believe whatever is shoveled at home without five seconds thought and work very hard at shutting down any one that happened to disagree with their socialist agenda. This was brought home by a meteorologist who discovered that 90% of NOAH's temperature sensors were installed contrary to NOAH's instructions. They were all supposed to be installed at least 100 yards from any man made structure. He found them ALL. He found them on asphalt roof tops. He found them in corners of blacktop parking lots. He found them installed next to digesters and microwave emitters. The rust is that 90% of the data from those sensors is corrupted and unreliable. That is but one small example of how flawed data can be utilized by unscruplous people to further a socialist agenda. He tried to get the message out and was stifled. You do not need to be an expert in mathematics to realize you have been shortchanged at a cash register. The fact is that carbon dioxide is not a check valve and you do not have enough understanding within you to even understand the point of that statement. The environment is NOT on the verge of collapse. Every time the government intervenes in something it makes it worse every time. The socialists pushed this nonsense. Any Republican that goes along to get along is spineless and will get voted out eventually. More people have their eyes open now than ever before and they have learned that they have been lied to. It is not that I know something that the scientific community doesn't know. It is the fact that I know something that YOU do not know. What is much worse is you do not WANT to know. Carbon dioxide is NOT a check valve. It is also heavier than air and EVERY scientists know that.

The environmental movement, and all of its nonsense including man made global warming, have been the new hone for socialism and communist these past 25 years or so. The socialists took over practically every publishing house in America. These are the same publishing houses that pick and choose who gets published and it is also where all public school text books get printed. The public s school system has been dominated by socialists for around forty years or more. As a result, we have high school students who graduate and can barely read. We have colleges lowering standards so drastically because your average high school student cannot pass entrance exams. The public colleges are hotbeds of propaganda where antifa comes from. You would think your average person would know why man made global warming is utterly impossible and that Carbon Dioxide cannot do what they claim it does. However, basic science and related principles are beyond most people today. Look how quickly they forgot what photosynthesis is? Look how they cannot figure out that the greenhouse effect cannot be true? Socialism has done this on purpose to destabilize and control.

(measuring a part on rings on trees) it is cyclic as he said, as there is summer and winter on earth, the solar system (sun and planets, earth etc) in space also have such times for selve preservation, its own way in making sure all works fine (same as seasons on easrth there is also seasons in space as it is part of the solar system where earth are part of). the earth was also made to be inhabited, and as long as more plants and trees are planted the earth will be able to keep ok status. Strang thing is like where i stay, they do measurments in areas on co2, but then they chopped hundreds and hundreds of big trees down and as soon as all were chopped, co2 went bit a up, so the government shouts global warming we need more taxes !. uuuhm, what will tax do to fix it, idiots, put back the damn trees!!. its all about money and control, now they can tax anything for global warming sake, but what does the money do for global warming, hey, what does it do. makes a certain part richer (like government and the ones making money out of this) and the average man on street poorer.

Appraisal Frauds/Liars loans etc. yet they still invested because of quick profits.<br /><br />A real argument would be why haven&#39;t the major countries put all efforts together to create a technological solution if climate change is such a big deal! No BS laws that or Co2 restriction goals. Create a technoloigie that absorbs co2 and all problems would be gone! <br />let say every country gives 0,25% (most of them throw away way more money for useless stuff and the military and endless wars!!)of their gdp for climate technologie that would be 200billion each year.

We will see higher changes over the next 20-30 years because it follows a period of excsseve industrial production of energy.(Even these small changes can have a detrimental effect on many species of animals and plants.) What i mean is that the problem is not yet really observed by temperature changes but by the unussually rapid increase of CO2 levels(caused by human activity).

But I know that just oil requires extraction and seperation from the ground which means oil factories heat it up which produces fumes. Gasoline requires further purification which means even more fumes. And when you finally put it inside your car it produces fumes again.Batteries on the other hand don't produce fumes when they work and in the case of Tesla cars they are rechargable which means that only the production of electricity in nearby factories would produce fumes to meet with the demand. And that's only if the factories work with ores.	UClWLeSFF9w9p-uRWt4auXIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClWLeSFF9w9p-uRWt4auXIw	1	Ugzr45PTAiv8eDEouG14AaABAg	We Love Libraries

The vast majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels when combined with the amount of coal burned to produce the batteries in the 1st place - there is far more pollution put into the environment than over the life of a Tesla than a standard car.

The scientific community has decades worth of data, from many different sources; not just ice cores (<a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/research/equable/isotope.html)">https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/research/equable/isotope.html)</a> but also sediment cores (<a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/climate-change/changing-ocean/evidence-sediment-cores/)">https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/climate-change/changing-ocean/evidence-sediment-cores/)</a> and the fossil record in general, basic physics and the measurement of just about every atmospheric and oceanic variable you can think of. If you think that scientists do not factor in every known cyclical variable, including the proximity of the sun to the Earth (and cyclical fluctuations in the radiation output from the sun), then you clearly think that you are smarter than the entire scientific community...educate yourself.

If you can control the source of the C02 you can control the quality of the emissions (lower dioxins etc) and work on Carbon Capture technology as well. For instance, A Dutch energy company, building a waste-to-energy plant which has a carbon capture and utilization (CCUS) system. They are hoping to achieve about 60,000 tons of liquefied CO2 to sell to Dutch greenhouse operations where vegetables, fruit, flowers, and other plants are grown. So a win for everyone, the waste doesn't ferment in a land fill to make methane (which is way worse for making Florida shrink)	UC0GjBrvR5yiJd2sFOoaij7g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0GjBrvR5yiJd2sFOoaij7g	1	UgyQk4GxfDOVNW3VieN4AaABAg	Brad Thomas

But what ever he says, I don't need him to tell me that climate change is a natural activity and has been with us since time began. We are not that significant on this world, we should not pollute in the traditional sense like leaving garbage every where, making rivers filthy and making the ocean a filthy mess in some places too. We may send a little garbage into the sky , but it is like what a several billion ants would send into the sky if they were brain capable with their size and produced "greenhouse gas s' " in the Sahara desert, nothing would be noticed.But we have an answer that has now advanced hugely to the point in development of safety and is a "no brainer" it's NUCLEAR POWER ! That answers all the freaks questions about clean air.The solar panels on my roof save me about $9 dollars a quarter, you know what they say, the salespeople "saw me coming" !!!

High Co2 would also increase Oxygen levels...besides the equation they use, they dont add everything that emits co2 in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere.. is there a problem? it seems that way.. But the likelyhood that co2 is causing it is so low its basically non-existent... Theres more evidence that nano- particulates like aluminum are more likely to creat the conditions we see, than CO2... and that actually has evidence to back it up.. Ground soil and water have tested positive for aluminum 1000x higher than what it should be... Aluminum raises ground ph.. and if PH goes over or under 7, plants cant retain certain minerals and viable nutrients... It turns in on itself and self destructs, and were seeing alot of that around the country and world in general.. High aluminum levels in the atmosphere would also cause drought and various dramatic conditions that were actually seeing right now...

It's also being pushed by politicians so hard because they want new taxes in the name of climate change so ultimately they can syphon into those new revenue streams down the road for their own benefits. And I find it funny that a lot of these phony climate change studies we're proven to be politically motivated and very biased. Essentially a lot of the data was scewed and any experts that disagreed were silenced. Reasonable people can agree that it's a good idea to work towards keeping the planet clean. Private industry and business already do that. However it's insane to trust any federal government. They should stay the fuck out and they are corrupt in nature and can't be trusted.

Climate has been changing and will always be changing. There is overwhelming scientific concensus that the warming we witnessed in the last century was caused by humans. First observed ice age was caused by the elimination of atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas, during the Great Oxygenation Event. The evolution of land plants at the onset of the Devonian period caused a long term increase in planetary oxygen levels and reduction of CO2 levels, which resulted in the Karoo Ice Age... do your research.

And regardless of all that the temperature of Earth has gone up and down all over the place throughout time. It has very little if anything to do with what humans are doing. According to all those climate alarmists a few decades ago much of the coasts should have been under water by now. Also worth noting that many thousands of years ago we had an ice age. Was that caused by humans? I think not. Climates change all the time regardless. So given that you have to question the political motives of those loudest in all this. Follow the $$.

I guess Penia does n&#39;t know or perhaps is in denial of how possessed he is by his ego. The story (not in this episode) of how &quot;hard&quot; his father was when he came out of a hospital after an operation and when he hugged him his arms were covered in blood cracked me up. Another funny occasion was when Rosie was interviewing him and Pena was sitting in a directors chair on a stage. I think Pena was in the phase of telling the audience that he would have no hesitation in taking anyone out in the parking lot (car park) if they wanted to fight him LOL. The chair collapsed and Pena ended up on the floor on his arse (ass). Complete buffoonery, but the look on Rosie&#39;s face was a classic. It reminded me of the centurions&#39; faces holding their laughter in, in the Biggus Dickus and Incontinentia Buttocks scene in the film, coincindently named The Life of Brain!

The reason many Geologists do not believe in it is because none of them went out in the field to check it out themselves OR ARE IN THE POCKETS OF OIL COMPANIES.

Oil is trapped in rock formations at different strata. A pool of oil might be spread out over large area. It depends on Extraction Costs. What is important is the rate in which can be retrieved which is the most important thing. It deepens on density which is important. Loans for the extractions are volatile as the oil is.

In 20 years you will change your mind and become a productive member in your society. This is when you realize that taxing carbon is only a tax on you and did nothing for the world. But hey, it made everyone feel good. Just remember, Taxing does not fix!!! All you will be allowing is for corporation to pollute more! If anyone knew anything, when corporations get taxed, they raise the price of goods and never ever pay that tax. Berny Sanders knows this gimmick and that why it sounds so good to the youth because they are clueless! Ya, Berny Sanders with 6 homes! LOL! What a hero to the poor. TAX THEM TO DEATH AND POVERTY!!!

High Co2 would also increase Oxygen levels...besides the equation they use, they dont add everything that emits co2 in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere.. is there a problem? it seems that way.. But the likelyhood that co2 is causing it is so low its basically non-existent... Theres more evidence that nano- particulates like aluminum are more likely to creat the conditions we see, than CO2... and that actually has evidence to back it up.. Ground soil and water have tested positive for aluminum 1000x higher than what it should be... Aluminum raises ground ph.. and if PH goes over or under 7, plants cant retain certain minerals and viable nutrients... It turns in on itself and self destructs, and were seeing alot of that around the country and world in general.. High aluminum levels in the atmosphere would also cause drought and various dramatic conditions that were actually seeing right now...

No, how wrong you are...... , volcanos with their ash and dust slightly obscures the earth and causes a cooling effect. Mount pinituba back in the mid 80's is an example of this. Mans output of co2 is dwarfed by mother nature, not only that mother nature uses the co2 for plants , more plants more o2. All around it's good .

Nobody can predict anything anymore. Our very own military satellites which are far more advance in climate and weather analysis needed by our military in conducting military activities are finding it extremely hard to predict and make a far more realistic weather projection months in advance! That is until we added the Milankovitch-cycle and <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2007/eirv34n09-20070302/06_709_sci.pdf">http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2007/eirv34n09-20070302/06_709_sci.pdf</a> and Mikhail Budyko, the leading Russian climatologist&#39;s scientific works <a href="http://21sci-tech.com/Articles%202004/Winter2003-4/global_warming.pdf">http://21sci-tech.com/Articles%202004/Winter2003-4/global_warming.pdf</a> However let’s assume that Budyko has been right and that everything, to the very ocean bottom, will be frozen. Will mankind survive this? I think yes, it would. The present technology of nuclear power, based on the nuclear fission of uranium and thorium, would secure heat and electricity supplies for 5 billion people for about 10,000 years. At the same time, the stock of hydrogen in the ocean for future fusion-basedreactors would suffice for 6 billion years. Our cities, industrial plants, food-producing greenhouses, our livestock, and also zoos and botanical gardens turned into greenhouses, could be heated virtually forever, and we could survive, together with many other organisms, on a planet that had turned into a gigantic glacier. I think, however, that such a “passive” solution would not fit the genius of our future descendants, and they would learn how to restore a warm climate for ourselves and for everything that lives on Earth.

They go into third world countries and preach to them about child labor, not understanding that working at a very young age is part of their culture, and an integral part of the total income for the family.

Because if c02 was 4200x 0.04% it would be over 168% of our current total atmosphere. So that "scientist" is also claiming our atmosphere was 68% thicker without including nitrogen, oxygen and argon. Maybe they were measuring it from the top of a volcanic explosion??? you're talking about levels that according to a gas analysis company (kane) >40,000 ppm Exposure may lead to serious oxygen deprivation resulting in permanent brain damage, coma, even death. So anything that needed oxygen would be affected greatly as you're talking about ppm's wayyyyy higher than 40,000.

"Albedo is defined as the percentage of solar (shortwave or ultraviolet) radiation reflected by a given surface. The range of albedo on the Earth's surface can be as little as 3% (0.03) for water and as high as 95% (0.95) for fresh snow cover." that doesn't sound very proportionate, also co2 isn't the only thing that absorbs infrared, ever heard of something called... water...? I never said co2 creates new energy you twat. Just because I use words like create doesn't mean literally create, you do understand that right? If I invest in a country I'm creating new wealth in that country without literally creating atomic wealth. 4. it's not, many people say 0.04 is too small to have noticeable consequences, this is fallacious. I used polonium to show that extremely small concentrations of things can have huge impacts, this isn't directly related to CO2 but to the notion that small concentrations can't have impacts. 5. Yes, it does, this is a consensus. Please, where are all your papers debunking this... 6. You're just arguing for the sake of arguing here, hmm why would the whole scientific community call them greenhouse gasses then? Think about this one as well. Again you dodge the main point, the flow of radiation or convection is irrelevant, it's about the "trapping" of heat properties each has. No one is arguing for what you just claimed I was arguing for... 7. yes, you are completely wrong here. As most energy doesn't interact with co2 doubling the co2 doubles the chances of reflecting it back to the surface given that gases are equally distributed. If there's enough co2 then radiation would have an extremely hard to escaping the planet. Again you say I'm making an argument for free energy which is absurd, you're grasping at straws. In regards to atmospheric pressure, If you do the math... your only to free Variables are Density and Temperature. The equation of state which gives you the pressure, is a material property. The equations for the atmospheric variables are interconnected at any moment, it is nonsense to say P causes T or T causes P. You could only make sense of this, if you would have a concrete change in T due to some radiative effect, or change P due to contraction. The point here that you don't recognize, is that the energy content of an atmospheric layer is always in flux. If the F up=F down then this is =σAT4. However to reach a high state of equilibrium flux (meaning: to reach a high T!) you have to have a mechanism to contain this flux somehow, and that is achieved by pulling a blanket over your atmosphere (a.k.a greenhouse effect). This makes some initial flux never be able to escape. So to summarize: The Equation of state is true at any given moment, but doesn't explain how all the heat got there, or stayed there. You have to look at the thermal history of Venus or the body of interest, to understand how the heat got there. (and thermal history means to solve the above mentioned equations, involving radiative windows etc. that you ignore.) You can't use proven science to disprove proven science. you’ve been disingenuous, misinterpreted most of my argument when it’s dead basic, haven’t been able to actually go beyond shallow definitions of science, can’t analyse at even a high school level. I also haven't fumbled any of your argument up, I understand what you're trying to say and that's why it's so easy to argue against you. You on the other hand just strawman me to death, saying that I'm making arguments for true creation of energy. Also ignoring what the implications of a nitrogenous atmosphere would do, can't grasp thought experiments, doesn't understand why I compare the moon to earth or venus to mars when it's not about size, gravity or pressure but differences in atmosphere, you can't tell me why venus got an atmosphere so thick when there's evidence there was once oceans... Dude go back to school. There is a massive consensus, you're straight up in denial.....

You brought up Venus, which was only only part of your argument that made any sense so I responded to that. *Whether it’s a planet or not is irrelevant, they’re both huge and can theoretically hold atmosphere given right conditions.* It's absolutely relevant. The moon and Mercury can't hold an atmosphere because the gravity is so low. The fact you are comparing Earth and Venus to them is ridiculous, and makes zero sense. *Why does Venus have an atmosphere that does this? What would happen if I waved a wand and Venus’s entire atmosphere turned into all Nitrogen? Have a real long think about it * The makeup of the atmosphere is irrelevant. It's the immense pressure that makes it so hot. It could be 100% Nitrogen, and all else being the same it would be just as hot. CO2 does not create heat. *CO2 equals shit tons of energy because instead of hitting the earth and flying back off into space it is reflected back onto Earth via greenhouse gasses… Why would you imply I’m making this an argument for true free energy* No it doesn't. The outgoing IR is proportional to the incoming IR. The heat (energy) in the climate system is dictated by the Sun. The amount of CO2 does not make a difference. CO2 does not create heat, and if there is not more heat coming in, there is not more for the Earth to absorb then re-emit, and if the CO2 molecules are at saturation at 15 micrometers it doesn't matter anyway. *Pollonium is a thought experiment on how small concentrations can equal large implications. Surprised you can understand pressure but not examples to support an idea* It's not a thought experiment. It's a false comparison fallacy. One has absolutely nothing to do with the other. *If the planets captures heat through greenhouse gases, adding more increases this capture of heat* No. It doesn't. I've already explained why multiple times. *The greenhouse is a way of describing how greenhouse gases work; of course it isn’t like a proper atmosphere, you’re disingenuous as fuck. Trapping is a way of explaining how the absorption and remittance occur in laymen, come on dude* Except it isn't. Greenhouse gases don't work like a greenhouse. Greenhouses operate through convection, the atmosphere through radiation. While there is convection in the atmosphere it doesn't apply to the GHE. *Now the vast majority of this energy that can be absorbed by CO2 is not absorbed at all. Doubling the CO2 would double the amount of possible reflections between radiation and greenhouse gases, so you’re completely wrong on that* No. I'm not. Doubling of CO2 just decreases the distance it has to travel before total saturation. Adding CO2 does not add heat, because CO2 cannot create heat. You keep going back to that. I think you need to go and look at how energy is distributed. CO2 cannot just create energy, that's not how it works. You need work to create energy. The Sun does it through nuclear fusion. *So overall, you’ve been disingenuous, misinterpreted most of my argument when it’s dead basic, haven’t been able to actually go beyond shallow definitions of science, can’t analyse at even a high school level* I'm not disingenuous, and I haven't misrepresented anything. I've responded to you point by point. Nothing I have said has been a "shallow" definition of science. You can;t actually rebut what I said so you bandy that BS out. * And to top it all off, you’re going against the consensus from the scientific community* There is no consensus. There never has been. It's a completely fabricated notion that has been thoroughly debunked multiple times.

You claimed my argument was “CO2 is what makes Venus so hot” when my argument was very clearly “Greenhouse gases make planets hotter”. Tell me, would Venus have become so hot without any sources of CO2 or other greenhouse gasses, what if it was an atmosphere full of nitrogen? 2. Thanks for pointing out why I compared them. One does not have an atmosphere to trap heat the other does. Whether it’s a planet or not is irrelevant, they’re both huge and can theoretically hold atmosphere given right conditions. 3. Yeah so you really can’t grasp it can you. Why does Venus have an atmosphere that does this? What would happen if I waved a wand and Venus’s entire atmosphere turned into all Nitrogen? Have a real long think about it… 4. Another strawman, CO2 equals shit tons of energy because instead of hitting the earth and flying back off into space it is reflected back onto Earth via greenhouse gasses… Why would you imply I’m making this an argument for true free energy… 5. I meant 0.04, I’m not exactly proof reading what I right. Pollonium is a thought experiment on how small concentrations can equal large implications. Surprised you can understand pressure but not examples to support an idea… 6. That’s an ever more moronic state. If the planets captures heat through greenhouse gases, adding more increases this capture of heat… 7. The greenhouse is a way of describing how greenhouse gases work; of course it isn’t like a proper atmosphere, you’re disingenuous as fuck. Trapping is a way of explaining how the absorption and remittance occur in laymen, come on dude… 8. I always say greenhouse gases because there is more than one. It’s funny how the specific wavelength it absorbs also happens to be infrared. “Each hour 430 quintillion joules of energy from the sun hits the earth”, that’s about the same amount of energy the whole world uses in a year. Now the vast majority of this energy that can be absorbed by CO2 is not absorbed at all. Doubling the CO2 would double the amount of possible reflections between radiation and greenhouse gases, so you’re completely wrong on that. So overall, you’ve been disingenuous, misinterpreted most of my argument when it’s dead basic, haven’t been able to actually go beyond shallow definitions of science, can’t analyse at even a high school level.

You brought up Venus, which is always used as a comparison to Earth in an attempt to show an actual example of the "runaway greenhouse effect". You wrote: "Another example is the very close planet Venus, it's atmosphere is extremely dense and mainly CO2, its surface tempearutre is around 400 degrees celcius" The reason people compare Earth and Venus is because they are close size, and have a relatively similar distance from the sun(in terms of distance is space). This is a common argument and example used. *I'm arguing that greenhouse affects makes planets hotter and two of my examples compared the EARTH to the MOON and MERCURY to VENUS* Why would you compare the Earth and the Moon? The moon is not a planet, and does not have an atmosphere. Why would you compare Mercury and Venus? Mercury doesn't have an atmosphere, and is a fraction of the size of Earth and Venus. You are comparing Apples and Bananas *What causes pressure than?* Really? Pressure is the result of force from gravity pulling down on the molecules in the atmosphere, and is dictated by the weight (density) of the atmosphere. So since Venus' atmosphere is so dense, the pressure is so great. Due to the complete cloud cover, most all energy (heat) introduced into the atmosphere whether it be a small amount from the Sun, or from the over 100,000 volcanoes on Venus' surface, it cannot escape. There is no energy balance. It's like a reverse Albedo effect. Again, having nothing to do with CO2. *The mass of the Venus atmosphere is about 90 times that of the Earth's atmosphere * Thanks for making my point for me. I've read your other responses, and you prove you have no clue what you are talking about. You think that CO2 introduces energy into the system which it doesn't. You said "This is when changes in 0.1% in CO2 concentrations equals shit tons of energy" You need to work to create energy (heat) and CO2 doesn't do that. Just because there is more CO2 does not mean there is more energy. That's not how it works. The energy comes from the Sun, not CO2. Even the GHE hypothesis shows this. *The first is that 0.4% is bigger than you think* It's 0.04, not 0.4. Then you go off on some tangent about Polonium, which is highly radioactive and not even in the same ballpark as CO2. Talk about a Straw Man. *However, the Greenhouse gases we produce kick this effect into overdrive* That's a moronic statement. There is nothing happening that has not happened before and all can be explained through natural variability. *You can think of how they work like this: you have a green house with glass tile as the roof to allow light in. The roof represents our atmosphere. As we pump more GHG's into our atmosphere we can replace the glass tiles in our roof with 1 way mirrors that allow light into our greenhouse but not out and reflect the light back to the ground of the green house. This in turn warms our greenhouse* The Earth's atmosphere is in no way shape or form like a greenhouse. This is a common misnomer. A greenhouse is closed system, while the atmosphere is an open system. A greenhouse has hard sides and ceiling, the atmosphere does not. GHG do not turn the atmosphere into a one way mirror, that is absurd. Greenhouse gasses don't "trap" heat, they absorb and immediately emit it. CO2 absorbs heat at 2.7, 4.3 and 15 micrometers, which means that most of the heat producing radiation escapes it, and is completely absorbed at 15 micrometers. This means that CO2 does whatever it's going to do in that amount of space. A doubling of CO2 would do the same thing at 5 meter, 10 meters, etc. All a doubling does is shorten the the radiation travels before being completely absorbed. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about, especially since you think 0.04% of our atmosphere dictates global temperature. Now go copy and paste a bunch of stuff from websites that you don't understand and think makes your point. Or just call me names.

Evolution occurs over many, many generations and is fine-tuned to thousands of environmental factors. As humans are able to adapt due to technology we're alright, but for the vast majority of creatures this means extinction, we are currently seeing extinction rates due to human-related activities not witnessed for a long time signalling a potential fourth mass extinction. Mass extinctions always occur because organisms aren't able to adapt to the speed and harshness of the environmental changes. The main worry for humans is where the vast majority of the population is situated in, when we go back millions of years to those levels you talk about, ocean levels reached a ridiculous maximum of 200m higher than current levels (this is fucking huge, and significantly reduced the available land area). Currently we're at a sea level height of a 130,000 year high and it's growing. bad things that happen to humans 1. precipitation patterns change, some places that aren't prepared for new rainfall get it and others that have depended on it for generations lose it, maybe they're farmers, maybe they're in an ecosystem that needs it 2. increases the likelihood of very hot days, living in a country where the summer days get over 40 there's not much you can do physically, elderly die, electronics break, and a LOT of energy is used to air condition every indoor space 3. This also increases the likelihood of heatwaves and droughts, I don't have to tell you why they're bad 4. our cryosphere or ice zones would melt raising our ocean level further, the biggest impact is that 1/6 of humans on the planet rely on the cryosphere for their seasonal water. 5. ocean: the more warm, the less co2 it can absorb, the hotter it gets (feedback loop), the ocean is very complicated but there might be changes in the currents system. Acidification might also cause a mass extinction of calcium-dependent creatures (there's a lot of them). Even the amount of oxygen in the ocean might decrease because of the temp change, very very very big deal if true. 6. the largest impact is the ocean level rising. anywhere there is low lying land, you're well and truly fucked. Africa, Asia, islands, arctic are especially fucked because of how reliant they are on river systems, undeveloped so they can't respond properly. these low lying zones are food centres for these countries, with them being effectively flooded millions will be affected and potentially millions more when looking at how far away that food went. higher temperatures also promote weed, pest and pathogens amongst our crops. 7. high temperatures are correlated with mental health problems https://www.inverse.com/article/49698-climate-change-negative-mental-health 8. the rising ocean levels displace a lot of people, the displacement of people coupled with changes in our agricultural sector may prove disastrous as a mixture of mass migration and demand for resources would occur leading to crime and civil unrest (this is a hypothetical, but backed up logically) THIS is what we do know, our climate is good right now, it promotes lives and humans do pretty well under them, under the certain changes climate change brings, we can hypothesise so bad things, maybe some good things, but ultimately we're letting a door open we don't need open. Things are good, let's not fuck them up. These problems are being slightly felt right now but the main victims are the generations to come, we might be the most dangerous generation that ever existed (Although the generation that nearly started a global nuclear war is hard to beat) We got something good, let's trust the scientific community that created everything you use, it's one of the few institutions on this planet who QUESTIONS every little claim someone makes about something, most scientists spend the majority of their careers either defending or critiquing scientific literature. Falsifying or exaggerating your work is career ending, scientists didn't get started for money, it's a passion, an obsession. last bit of your question CO2 is a pollutant because we're releasing it into the environment and it has undesired effects. whereas water is precipitated out with the rain cycle, co2 lasts decades in the atmosphere. H2O could be considered a pollutant if we hypothetically started pumping trillions of litres in the ocean from somewhere and we all drowned. Weird last point from you, but even drinking too much water can kill you, come on man, now you're not being logical.

In fact, many greenhouse operations raise C02 levels to 1000ppm to 2000ppm to increase yield and humans work in those environments with no adverse effect. And, CO2 is necessary for plant life, so I'd hardly call it a pollutant. Using your logic, water is a pollutant.

Dry air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, argon, co2 and other gasses. Nitrogen and oxygen as stable room temp gases have great thermal conductivity properties (stop heat transfer through contact) but poor resistance to thermal radiation (electromagnetic radiation including heat, light radiowaves etc) and convection (heat traveled through liquid like steam). However they're both poor absorbers of heat (like painting something white, it's going to reflect more heat than hold onto it in most cases). CO2 is the evil twin to in and will take the place of black paint (it tends to absorb anything it can get its hands on) if you're black paint, because you absorb more you get hotter. So why does CO2 absorb heat? it has a Carbon molecule in the middle with two oxygen molecule attached separately. Now every atom vibrates but this configuration allows CO2 to act like a rubber band (the connection to the two oxygen atoms with a central carbon atom could be thought of as a spring), this rubber band effect (this is a very basic explanation) allows CO2 to be hit with heat energy and interact with it (as opposed to it just passing thought), eventually re-emitting it right back to the surface. CO2 can absorb energy from specific microns in the energy range (which coincidentally happens to be heat energy), most other radiation just passes through. Talking about this elastic effect, water is even better at this then CO2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwtt51gvaJQ This is a good video showing how a heat lamp aimed at two bottles of liquid will raise the temperature higher in the bottle with co2 in it. http://www.wag.caltech.edu/home/jang/genchem/infrared.htm this is a really good explanation on absorbtion properties of chemical but a bit dry and hard to grasp So how can so little have such a big effect? Two ways of answering this. The first is that 0.4% is bigger than you think, how much Polonium do you think the body needs to absorb in order to notice something?a mere 0.089 micro-grams and your liver, spleen, kidneys and bone marrow start failing. There's 62 billion micro-grams in 62kg (Average weight of person on earth), so going by those numbers we only need 0.00000000014% of a certain substance in our body to have significant effects. when talking about CO2 we can look at here to see how much 0.4% would look like in gas (Yes, without gravity, the gas fill out the space evenly so you can get uniform distribution of gas. Certainly, it only occurs at thermodynamic equilibrium, that is, if you wait for a long time) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81FHVrXgzuA The reason such a small amount of CO2 or methane can make such a huge difference is because there is SO MUCH energy from the sun striking the planet every day (over 12,000 gigawatt-hours, more than 20,000x what the human race consumes) that even a very small change in how much gets absorbed can lead to a significant temperature change. This is when changes in 0.1% in CO2 concentrations equals shit tons of energy. We also have a bunch of other greenhouse gases that do the same thing. Long story short, trees came along and used co2, it lowered co2 and started terraforming the planets atmosphere whilst also storing all that co2 and energy it had when it died in various forms (coal being one of them) , however, now we're witnessing deforestation which weakens this carbon sink. Oceans are also the largest carbon sink we have A LOT of co2 gets absorbed by the ocean but as we increase co2 that warms the earth oceans slightly warm, warming of oceans actually decrease the amount of gas it holds because of vapor pressure, another problem comes along with specifically h20 and cO2 reacting, and that the creation of carbonic acid which is very unstable and splits back into its original forms when heated. Because of this forced release of co2 higher temperatures have (they even promote more bushfires as it's hotter and dryer), we get a positive feedback loop (OR a snowball effect in laymans terms) we the more co2 that is let out the higher the temp becomes which in turns liberates more co2 which in turn increases the temperature until we get smothering clouds of co2 like venus (Disclaimer: this would take a looooong time though and our best weapon against it is our enormous OCEAN and dense TREES) So it all comes down to equilibrium, the current climate and atmosphere has been essentially stable. The bush-fires, volcanoes and all that other natural co2 shit is all a part of this delicate balance the global ecosystem has worked with for millenia. Now to answer your follow up questions. We are currently in a state of natural global warming, the earth is ever so slightly warming and if all humans died out tomorrow the world would continue to warm. However, the Greenhouse gases we produce kick this effect into overdrive (a catalyst, nitrous oxide for your car, fuel for the fire). Now back to those certain events Much of it I to do with Milankovitch cycles and Sun Spots. There are 3 types of Milankovitch Cycle. Firstly, eccentricity is how elliptical our orbit is, the more elliptical the warmer it gets. Secondly, axial tilt which is what angle the earth axis is to the vertical. The greater the degree of tilt, right now its about 23, the warmer it is between the tropics. And lastly there is precession which is more complicated but is basically which direction our axis points to. I believe if the axis is pointing toward the sun it gets warmer. However, Milankovitch cycles take tens of thousands of years to go through their cycles. So although I'm sure these affected the medieval warm epoch it was probably more to do with sun spots. The more sun spots that are on the sun the warmer the earth gets as sun spots areeffectively just large warmer areas on the sun, blasting more energy toward Earth. Simply put globally warming is due to Green House Gases (GHG) like Carbon Dioxide and Water Vapour. You can think of how they work like this: you have a green house with glass tile as the roof to allow light in. The roof represents our atmosphere. As we pump more GHG's into our atmosphere we can replace the glass tiles in our roof with 1 way mirrors that allow light into our greenhouse but not out and reflect the light back to the ground of the green house. This in turn warms our greenhouse.	UCsPmIRW-uuduLDTUK5BkDmw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsPmIRW-uuduLDTUK5BkDmw	1	UgyrDja9JZZD1yjd6KN4AaABAg	Unkn0wn Albertan

Although the fact that there is less than half of 1 percent CO2 total in the atmosphere in relation to the other 99.5 percent of gases should be reason for a respectable argument in any case . Whilst we are getting all " scientific " can you explain to me the reasons for the medievel warming period ( where it is Scientifically acknowledged that it was at least 2° Celcius warmer ) and also the mini ice age ?? ( the Thames in London would freeze enabling people to walk across ) Did the people of these periods have turbo charged diesel handcarts polluting the air or was it MAYBE just part of the earth's natural cycle ??

But you're making a massive strawman lmao (how ironic). I'm not arguing that Venus is hotter than Earth because of greenhouse gases you fuckstick. I'm arguing that greenhouse affects makes planets hotter and two of my examples compared the EARTH to the MOON and MERCURY to VENUS. The earth and moon are close but one is freezing, one is relatively warm (explanation: Earths atmosphere has greenhouse gases, which trap heat). What causes pressure than? Is it not the atmospheric condition essentially caused by greenhouse gasses? Venus is no where near dense enough for its surface temperature to be affected by its mass to equal the numbers we see. Mercury is closer to the sun than Venus (A lot closer, 50 million km closer), however Venus, is hotter than mercury. Comparing Venus to earth isn't something I did, you trying to straw-man me bro? The WHOLE fucking point was to show that despite different circumstances in terms of location, greenhouse gases seem to a huge factor in a planets temperature with C02 being the major factor in Venus's terms (96% C02 atmosphere content). Why is Venus so hot and able to retain its heat unlike Mercury (the chilly night side can get as cold as minus 290 F (minus 180 C) https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/292/nasa-climate-modeling-suggests-venus-may-have-been-habitable/ This article from NASA even says there may have been liquid oceans and even habitable temperatures "Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system" - NASA Now I know why you hesitated to comment lmao, because you're either confused, disingenuous or nit-picky. I'm going with a mix on all 3. Without Earths atmosphere that has greenhouse gases like CO2 we would eventually be freezing, just like the moon. Some more info: The atmosphere of Venus is mostly carbon dioxide, 96.5% by volume. Most of the remaining 3.5% is nitrogen The mass of the Venus atmosphere is about 90 times that of the Earth's atmosphere With a name like Venus, one expects the planet to be heavenly, but it is more like hell! With hotter-than-an-oven temperatures and 90 times the Earth's pressure, it's 96% carbon dioxide atmosphere gives us an example of the greenhouse effect gone wild! But a glance at the planet data table for Venus makes it clear that it is very much like the Earth. So why doesn't the Earth have a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? One straightforward answer is that the carbon dioxide which may have been present in greater concentrations in the Earth's early atmosphere got dissolved into the oceans and trapped into solid compounds in the surface minerals, so that nearly all of it is gone from the present atmosphere. In the frightening scenario of a runaway greenhouse effect on the earth, which transformed all the presently trapped carbon into gaseous carbon dioxide, the Earth could become similar to the present Venus. So the vast differences in the current states of the two planets arise from rather small differences in initial temperatures and atmospheric concentrations. The heat-trapping by the Earth's atmosphere was not sufficient to lead to a progressively rising temperature.

Venus is 66C at the altitude where the pressure = 1000 millibars. On Earth at the altitude where pressure = 1000Mb it is about 15C. At equal pressure Venus is much, much hotter. Atmospheric pressure varies as the temperature, the temperature at any given pressure level in Venus' atmosphere should be 1.176 times the temperature at that same pressure level in the Earth atmosphere, independent of the different levels of infrared absorption in the two atmospheres. Venus is closer to the Sun, and gets proportionally more power from it. The Earth is 93 million miles from the Sun, while Venus is only 67.25 million miles. Because of this, Venus receives 1.91 times the power that Earth receives. Per the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the radiating temperature of Venus should be the fourth-root of 1.91 (or the square-root of 93/67.25) = 1.176 times that of the Earth. This is all without any greenhouse effect.	UCqxe6-xx86o48gVB2vs5MzQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqxe6-xx86o48gVB2vs5MzQ	1	UgyrDja9JZZD1yjd6KN4AaABAg	Unkn0wn Albertan

This is very crude, but it's ELI5. Also as an aside, it's somewhat of a diversion tactic to say, "it's only a small amount, therefore, it can't be that important." Skeptics/denialists love this tactic but it's pretty flawed. Think of it this way: It won't take but a very small amount of cyanide (less than 1% of body weight) in my body to notice it. The reason such a small amount of CO2 or methane can make such a huge difference is because there is SO MUCH energy from the sun striking the planet every day (over 12,000 gigawatt-hours, more than 20,000x what the human race consumes) that even a very small change in how much gets absorbed can lead to a significant temperature change.

High Co2 would increase Oxygen levels... And they dont add everything co2 emits in the equation.. Everything emits CO2.. From bacteria to nematodes, to volcanoes and deciduous forest, even the oceans... Thats not including the big game mammals and other organisms... The number is massive, and its actually down from the past.. The megalithic era had tons more species or plants and animals, and everything was giant.. Rodents the size of mules, Birds that could pick up a full grown man, ANd insects as big as cats and dogs... and there was exponentially more varieties of animals and insects... If co2 damaged the ozone, the world would have died out long ago... They cant prove that CO2 is actually thinning our atmosphere.. Theres no connection.. Its actually a precautionary thing, thats how it started... The ozone is thinning and we THINK humans and oil use may be causing it... This was a theory, and it wasnt put forth by meteorologist or biologist.. It was put forth by politicians and the like... TO date, there is no scientific evidence that says CO2 can thin our atmosphere..

You’re probably breathing it at about 800 - 900ppm. In my area of North America, the Greenhouse Industry (vegetables and flowers) run CO2 generators to boost indoor greenhouse CO2 levels to between 800 - 1300ppm depending on the crop. People work in those greenhouses for eight hour shifts. I spent four hours in some of them on tours. One of the greenhouses I was in had a level of 980ppm CO2. Actually felt refreshing. CO2 only becomes bad when you get to about 4000 or 5000ppm and you start to notice it a bit. 10,000ppm would not be nice, but in all Earth’s history it has never gone over about 7000ppm, and that was about 550 million years ago or something. So yes, you already breath CO2, and you can breath it okay up to certain levels much higher than what is in the atmosphere right now.

I said it is not plant food just as oxygen isn't mammal food. It is used for respiration. Thanks for the reply, but it isn't relevant to what I was stating. Plants need many components to grow, adding only CO2 without adding the other components isn't going to make a self balancing system where plants double in order to absorb double the atmospheric CO2. I think you mean to reply to the other people who were saying that we can't breathe CO2, I wasn't one of them. In a later post you end up saying the same thing I am; there is such thing as too much.

In confined spaces co2 will be at the bottom of the confined space because it is heavier. Thankfully the planet is not so confined and there are plants to absorb co2 and exhale oxygen. When plants die they will expel co2 in order to boost the new plant growth much like a spider gives up it lives blood to it's offspring.

Sure you can breath carbon DIOXIDE... depending on the concentration.....In our area, the Greenhouse Industry boosts their CO2 levels to anywheres from 800 - 1300 ppm... depending on the crop. People regularly work 8 hours a shift in the greenhouses with that concentration with no ill effects..I've personally spent hours in greenhouses with 1,200 ppm co2 and actually felt refreshed... Over 1500 ppm you might feel a bit drowzy.......over 3,000 ppm.... you might feel a bit ill..... over 5,000ppm... you will be sick.. headaches... poor attention..poor concentration...nausea... dizziness... But our Greenhouse Industry doesn't go over 1,300 ppm co2.. ANYTHING can be poisonous in a large enough concentration. Ordinary WATER is poisonous if taken in too large a dose..In rare cases, drinking an extreme amount in a short time can be dangerous. It can cause the level of salt, or sodium, in your blood to drop too low. That's a condition called hyponatremia.It's very serious, and can be fatal. You may hear it called water intoxication.

They need oxygen, right? Is oxygen enough to make them healthy and grow? Obviously not. They need milk as well. We know that too much milk (or any liquid) will kill them. The same goes for plants, they need the right balance of many different compounds. We are increasing one compound and none of the others that plants need. With increasing temperatures caused by greenhouse gasses we are taking away water (through evaporation) in most instances, and other times flooding them (through extreme storms) with more than they can use and thus killing them. The same goes for other nutrients that they need, and also the heat and co2 levels are introducing pests and fungi that the kill the plants. It isn't plant food and even if it was it would not matter since it isn't in quantities that the plants can process given the other things the plants need.

And so what? There is such thing as too much of a good thing. The plants can only use so much, and the rest is left in the atmosphere. The plants need a balance of nutrients and compounds to grow, just throwing more co2 at them isn't going to do it otherwise farmers wouldn't be using ACTUAL plant food and fertilizer. Hotter temperatures make water evaporate more quickly, and guess what plants also need to grow? This man Pena himself says he is an oil man and always will be. Why are we discussing his claims when he says he is on the side of the oil companies. It is also absurd that he says it happened 50,000 years ago so let's not worry about it. We didn't have 6 billion people living on the coasts with trillions of dollars of infrastructure to support them.

Exposure to concentrations of 10 percent or more of carbon dioxide can cause death, unconsciousness, or convulsions.", although it does play roles in our body necessary for complete function, so does gastric acid. The reason CO2 is so important in the discussion can be made with a quick google search, although that's asking too much of you. When you look at the moon, it's at the same relative proximity to the sun as us but is desolate and freezing, this is because it lacks an atmosphere to trap emitted energy from the sun. Another example is the very close planet Venus, it's atmosphere is extremely dense and mainly CO2, its surface tempearutre is around 400 degrees celcius... Mercury, which is a LOT CLOSER to the sun, has very little atmosphere and its temperature varies from -127 to 400 degrees celcius. I hope you can see the role atmosphere plays, CO2 is just one of the components that contribute due to its structure (it absorbs heat because of its absorbtion and emitting properties), there are also water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone.

So you are happy that US has clean water and air while your country bombed the shit out of the rest of the planet, destroyed entire countries, displaced populations.. not to mention you yourself are sitting on the luxuries afforded to you by destroying the native civilization of Americas and the brutal subjugation of blacks, who are still hated and hunted by your law enforcement. Climate change is real and there are already places on earth that are sinking due to rising sea levels. Just because it does not have an immediate impact of stupid white Americans (even though parts of Florida are going under, California recently came out of severe drought, hurricanes and blizzards are getting more intense and frequent.), they think it is not a real issue. Just like they think racism or gun violence are not real issues while kids get shot every week.

As long as a problem does not affect a stupid white American directly, they pretend it doesn't exist, whether it be racism or anthropogenic climate change. This is the only "developed" country where people consistently vote against their own self-interest -- I mean how brainwashed does one have to be to achieve that? Even insects instinctively understand self-preservation, but not Americans. As long as they have "Muh guns, Muh family values and Muh Bible", they'd vote a chimpanzee. The only reason the U.S. appears developed is because it is the immigrants who have built most of the wealth -- take away all the non-white CEOs, Founders and workers, and American economy will be zero.. that is the only thing they had going for them and now they plan to restrict even that. It is hilarious that the most technologically advanced country in the world cannot even figure out how to stop little children from getting shot at in schools, but have strong opinions on everything from climate change to abortion to evolution to vaccination.

Fraud is the just-under-the-radar subsidies to the oil industry in the billions of dollars. Fraud is getting the hairsprays and ozone layer confused with global warming and being so ignorant as to not realize that the ozone layer is better - because governments took it seriously and did something about it. And fraud is to be shocked that post-carbon industry is becoming big business in its own right when you;re promoting enterprise-friendly values. Neither Brian nor Dan did even basic homework prior to this conversation; that&#39;s not fraud but it is embarrassing. As to why someone laughed when Dan asked a question - that&#39;s extremely subjective and maybe they laughed because of the context or the way the question was asked. I wouldn&#39;t base policy on Dan saying some people laughed at something.	UCYHIeNXdHXiu5XnUivAnblg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYHIeNXdHXiu5XnUivAnblg	0

If its so bad, why have we not done like anything the last years? People high up in the chain choose climate change to scare us the public to invest money in it and so on...

The guy literally claims that the difference of 10-15000 times the energy from the sun is caused by the distance to the sun. It's hilarious seeing some blatantly anti-Semitic or idiotic replies, or even this idiotic video where you guys have to deny all of science because no one else agrees with you. You guys claim others to be indoctrinated, yet sit and watch ten minutes of this garbage thinking you're learning something. I took something out of this video: Pena is an idiot who should stick to business. Denying evidence in a fanatic attempt to change reality changes nothing.

Have a word with Prince Phillip, Charles, and William (on his third child) and Bill Gates too, they all love the depop idea too, even though they are all, (one way or another) social parasites! Bill even sends third world countries free meds to turn them sterile, as an extra surprise with their vaccinations! And just think of David Rockerfella, lived to 100 with 7 or 8 heart transplants, and he too was very much in favour of depopulation! Strange that he didn't volunteer.... Really, there should be some reward for you volunteers,. What would you like? Anyway, I'll just send your name off to the U.N., (save you the trouble) as they're the ones leading this push. They will be so happy, I'm sure they'll make it completely painless, they wouldn't want to be compared to Hitler now, would they? They should get back to you very soon, they've been looking for volunteers.	UCDPEJd9Z6vM4GIwjN11jInQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPEJd9Z6vM4GIwjN11jInQ	1	UgyDw8YhOinxlvO-IaR4AaABAg	Fritz Meier
