Casey:Former White House space program advisor, consultant to NASA Headquarters, and space shuttle engineer. He is one of America's most successful climate change researchers and climate prediction experts. Mr. Casey is the leading advocate in the US for a national and international plan to prepare for the next climate change to one of a dangerous cold climate era. This new cold era is caused by a historic decline in the Sun's energy output, what he calls a \\\"solar hibernation.\\\"In the spring of 2007, he became the first researcher to announce this dramatic change in the Sun to the White House and the mainstream media. In addition to correctly predicting the hibernation of the Sun, recently confirmed by NASA and other science organizations, he has correctly predicted the end of global warming, and the long term decline in the Earth's temperatures.He is the author of the internationally acclaimed climate science book, \\\"Cold Sun\\\" which describes the rationale for understanding why global warming has ended and the effects of the new cold climate era. Mr. Casey is currently President of the climate research company, the Space and Science Research Corporation (SSRC), in Orlando, Florida. Through his years in climate research he has been outspoken in saying that the Sun is the primary driver to climate change. He was named \\\"America's best climate prediction expert,\\\" by Watchdogwire.com in March 2013. Mr. Craig Rucker:A native of Buffalo, New York, who received his Masters of Public Administration from the State University of New York at Albany, Craig Rucker is a co-founder of CFACT and currently serves as its executive director. For over 20 years, Craig has provided expertise to a wide range of government, academic, media, and industry forums. He serves as co-host of CFACT's daily national radio commentary called \\\"Just the Facts\\\" that has been airing on some 125 radio stations from coast to coast since 1993. Rucker has written extensively on numerous environmental policy issues, and his work has been featured in such media outlets as CNN, the BBC, USA Today, the Des Moines Register, the Cleveland Plain-Dealer, The Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. Rucker has had primary responsibility for helping build CFACT's Collegians program on more than 40 campuses across the country, and has attended or brought student delegations to major United Nations conferences in Copenhagen, Istanbul, Kyoto, Bonn, Marrakesh, Cancun, and Montreal.
