Where will we go first? Probably the closest system to ours, since it'll be the fastest. Which system is that? The Alpha Centauri System, with three stars, and at least one planet, which we think may even be habitable. What do they look like? What do we know about them?

Imagine throwing a ball and if it hits the backboard it somehow gets directed into the hoop. Thanks to physics it isn't quite possible to make ALL possible shots go in though you can make a hoop where the ball goes in a lot more often. In this video I show how I wrote a program to calculate the optical backboard then machined and fabricated it.

Imagine if every day invisible pathogens threatened to take your life away...pathogens that were harmless to other people because they were naturally protected against them. You are a special case indeed, and there will be no contact or cuddles with other people for as long as you live. You’ll never feel the touch of another person’s skin...not even your own mother’s. The very planet is your predator, the air is pervasive with invisible threats that lay in wait to finish you off.
