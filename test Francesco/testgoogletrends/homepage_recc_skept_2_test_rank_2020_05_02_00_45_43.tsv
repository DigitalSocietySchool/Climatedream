This was a large 4-stage telescopic cylinder that I work on once in a while. I have to remove the blind end in order to remove all of the tubes to complete a full rebuild of the cylinder. These videos were mainly focused on the machining and removal of the blind end and corresponding stop tubes for each tube. I did try and film the testing process but the camera was acting up and I didnt get it all. But I hope you enjoy anyways.

As I wandered through the tax-free shopping transit area of the airport, which in any case was closed, I spotted an opportunity.Doha Airport Hotel, a sign next to a lift read. However that idea was stillborn. For the price of a bed to sleep on for a measly 6 hours at Doha airport hotel is $300 US! An outrage I thought and stormed out.With no hope off getting any sleep my mind turned to food. There are two airport lounges open to non-members at Doha airport. The Onyx lounge at $55 seemed hardly worth even $10, given their non-existant sofas, the world's lousiest selection of chairs and an even worse assortment of so called snacks they had on offer. I'm not gonna pay $55 for an Ikea chair and some Wallmart cornflakes!The other option is the Doha Airport Business Lounge. At $130 it's nearly 3 times the price of the Onyx lounge, but does the food selection, sleeper chairs, sofas and other amenities like showers and two dinner buffets make the outrageous price worthwhile?Harald went to investigate...."	11470	430	261715	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/U2LFvzYrDlg/hqdefault.jpg"	" "	"People & Blogs"	"True"	"False"	"2020-04-29"	6

Where does it end, and what lies beyond its star fields and streams of galaxies extending as far as telescopes can see?These questions are beginning to yield to a series of extraordinary new lines of investigation and technologies that are letting us to peer into the most distant realms of the cosmos. But also at the behavior of matter and energy on the smallest of scales. Remarkably, our growing understanding of this kingdom of the ultra-tiny, inside the nuclei of atoms, permits us to glimpse the largest vistas of space and time.  In ancient times, most observers saw the stars as a sphere surrounding the earth, often the home of deities. The Greeks were the first to see celestial events as phenomena, subject to human investigation rather than the fickle whims of the Gods. One sky-watcher, for example, suggested that meteors are made of materials found on Earth... and might have even come from the Earth. Those early astronomers built the foundations of modern science. But they would be shocked to see the discoveries made by their counterparts today. The stars and planets that once harbored the gods are now seen as infinitesimal parts of a vast scaffolding of matter and energy extending far out into space. Just how far began to emerge in the 1920s. Working at the huge new 100-inch Hooker Telescope on California's Mt. Wilson,  astronomer Edwin Hubble, along with his assistant named Milt Humason, analyzed the light of fuzzy patches of sky... known then as nebulae. They showed that these were actually distant galaxies far beyond our own. Hubble and Humason discovered that most of them are moving away from us. The farther out they looked, the faster they were receding. This fact, now known as Hubble's law, suggests that there must have been a time when the matter in all these galaxies was together in one place. That time, when our universe sprung forth, has come to be called the Big Bang. How large the cosmos has gotten since then depends on how long its been growing and its expansion rate. Recent precision measurements gathered by the Hubble space telescope and other instruments have brought a consensus... That the universe dates back 13.7 billion years. Its radius, then, is the distance a beam of light would have traveled in that time ... 13.7 billion light years. That works out to about 1.3 quadrillion kilometers. In fact, it's even bigger.... Much bigger. How it got so large, so fast, was until recently a deep mystery.That the universe could expand had been predicted back in 1917 by Albert Einstein, except that Einstein himself didn't believe it until he saw Hubble and Humason's evidence. Einstein's general theory of relativity suggested that galaxies could be moving apart because space itself is expanding. So when a photon gets blasted out from a distant star, it moves through a cosmic landscape that is getting larger and larger, increasing the distance it must travel to reach us. In 1995, the orbiting telescope named for Edwin Hubble began to take the measure of the universe... by looking for the most distant galaxies it could see. Taking the expansion of the universe into account, the space telescope found galaxies that are now almost 46 billion light years away from us in each direction... and almost 92 billion light years from each other. And that would be the whole universe... according to a straightforward model of the big bang. But remarkably, that might be a mere speck within the universe as a whole, according to a dramatic new theory that describes the origins of the cosmos.ABOUT USHere at SpaceRip, we value the exploration of the unknown. We surpass boundaries for the sake of uncovering the mysteries of the cosmos and what they may tell us about our origin and our future. With our videos, we hope to educate our viewers on how we fit into the universe, and more so how we can do our part to better it."	2395	116	138748	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-jSg336Cgq8/hqdefault.jpg"	" "	"Science & Technology"	"True"	"False"	"2020-04-13"	8

"Fable the Raven |  Did you know Ravens can talk?! - YouTube"	"2d3dOam9Hg4"	"Falconry And Me"	"/channel/UCP8HS6Ge4ofqXxDZhANMnQQ"	99800	"Hello everyone :) I'm back after a five year gap, wow! Look out for loads of new content on my falconry birds in the coming weeks.However this video today is all about a very special bird of mine I'd like you to meet. She's not a bird of prey but she's very awesome in her own way and I am planning a mini series all about her.Fable is a two year old raven. She is captive bred and I hand reared her from just a few weeks old.Ravens can live over 40 years so she has a lot of time ahead of her to learn. She can already articulate over 50 words and noises and loves to solve puzzles and hide/bury her favourite things - more on that in the next videos.**For those of you who have questions about why I keep birds...**IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO WRITE \"SET HER FREE SHE SHOULD BE IN THE WILD\"...please watch this video. It explains all about her:https://youtu.be/sOwpvFtYcTMI am a falconer. All of my birds are captive bred, not wild, but they free fly on a daily basis. And my birds of prey hunt with me. The bars on her avariy are to stop her climbing. If I was to use square mesh she would climb up and push her lovely wing and tail feathers through the wire and break/damage them. Bars allow her to see out (she likes to stick her head out to see what I'm doing) but keeps her in good condition. She free flies too, however sometimes when I open the doors of her avairiy she can't be bothered to go out. Ravens like what they know and to her, her avariy is her territory and safe space! Our falcony birds have long lifespans compared to wild birds because we are able to give them a good diet everyday, vet care if ever needed, and plenty of free flying, whilst helping them avoid dangers their wild counterparts would come across.Around 80% of wild birds of prey will not survive beyond a year old, and the average lifespan is around 3 years. Our captive bred birds can live well into their 30s and 40s, sometimes longer. My oldest bird is 33, and is expected to live around 40 years.Falconry techniques allow us to successfully rescue injured wild birds of prey and release them as strong, fit individuals. Falconers spend a lot of time working with wild bird of prey projects conserving some very endangered species.Don't forget to like & share, and let me know what you'd like to see and learn about in the comments below.

"The Future of Quantum Computing Could Live on a Cryogenic Chip - YouTube"	"HhBFs5qEJ5U"	"Seeker"	"/channel/UCzWQYUVCpZqtN93H8RR44Qw"	4370000	"Commercially viable quantum computing could be here sooner than you think, thanks to a new innovation that shrinks quantum tech down onto a chip: a cryochip. » Subscribe to Seeker! http://bit.ly/subscribeseeker» Watch more Elements! http://bit.ly/ElementsPlaylist» Visit our shop at http://shop.seeker.com It seems like quantum computers will likely be a big part of our computing futurebut getting them to do anything super useful has been famously difficult. Lots of new technologies are aiming to get commercially viable quantum computing here just a little bit faster, including one innovation that shrinks quantum technology down onto a chip.Enter: the cryogenic chip.But first, a quick refresher on how quantum computing works. Unlike a classical bit, a quantum computer uses quantum bits, or qubits, to make calculations. These qubits have the potential to be super powerful, providing quantum computers with the potential to run really complex calculations exponentially faster than classical computers. But qubits are also really, really hard to both make and control. Today, quantum computers have less than 100 qubits, but in order to tackle problems we want answers to, we will need to scale up to million-qubit systems. That means that we will need a more sustainable way to control the behavior of qubits. One solution? A cryogenic computer chip. Intel just debuted a chip its calling Horse Ridge, a technology that takes the electronics needed to control the qubits, and puts them on a chip thats capable of functioning at about 4 Kelvin, so they can live inside the cryogenic chamber with the qubits. But how does this cryogenic chip work, how realistic of a solution is it really, and what could it mean for the future of quantum computing? Find out in this Elements. #quantum #computers #intel #technology #cryogenic #seeker #science #elementsRead More: Cryo-chip overcomes obstacle to large-scale quantum computershttps://qutech.nl/cryo-chip-overcomes... \"The researchers demonstrated experimentally both proper operation of the integrated circuit and an ability to drive a real spin qubit. Spin qubits are among the promising qubit candidates for a large-scale quantum computer.\"Physicists Successfully Use 'Hot' Qubits to Overcome a Huge Quantum Computing Problem https://www.sciencealert.com/new-tech... \"As quantum computers continue to grow in size and complexity, engineers are hitting a major obstacle. All of that added machinery means higher temperatures - and if anything can ruin a perfectly good quantum bit, it's heat.\"Are We Ready for Quantum Computers?https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/...   \"Feynman really launched the field of quantum computing when he suggested that the best way to study quantum systems was to simulate them on quantum computers.\" ____________________Elements is more than just a science show.

In her Op-Doc, From Journalist to Hostage, director Sonia Kennebeck explores those questions at close range, through the story of a reporter who was held captive by Somali pirates for two and a half years. Many commentators have suggested that journalists like Michael Scott Moore have no business taking such risks  and shouldnt expect sympathy or aid.

He explains how stratospheric ozone is formed when diatomic oxygen absorbs an ultraviolet photon and is split into two free oxygen atoms.  The free atoms bond with another oxygen molecule to form an ozone molecule creating a stable ozone layer.  He then explains how chlorine atoms released from chlorofluorocarbon molecules act as an enzyme to breakdown up to 100,000 ozone molecules.  The Montreal Protocol was a treaty signed by countries on the planet to reduce the amount of CFCs in the atmosphere to protect the ozone layer. Do you speak another language?

Neil deGrasse Tyson is here to help you answer that question alongside comic co-host Chuck Nice. And, youre about to find out why the answer is easy to understand, but not that simple. Youll learn how the white light from the sun interacts with the atmosphere through a process called Rayleigh scattering that makes the sky blue. Neil tells us why the sky turns different shades as the day goes on, and why the sunset changes from blue to amber. Discover why the reason we have a blue sky is the same reason you cant see stars during the daytime. And, how this lead to the discovery of the operational definition of where the atmosphere ends and space begins. Neil explains why he thinks space should be defined by gravity and not by the circumstances of our atmosphere. Lastly, Neil gives us a lesson on the frailty of our atmosphere and our delicate place among the stars.
