"SUBMARINE PASSING THROUGH MINES DIORAMA-Epoxy Resin Art - YouTube"	"PM_-WBmbNJc"	"4THECRAFT"	"/channel/UCdzDAXqWKLuQ58zNtxJUZXw"	89300	"Hello dear Friends and welcome back to my channel,In this episode I have made a diorama showing a submarine passing through naval mines.For the submarine I have used the Revell plastic kit “U Boat type VII C” with a scale 1:350.I have made the naval mines from polymer clay and black wire. Finally, I have created the diorama inside epoxy resin. For the sea surface I have used first an application of Gell Gloss Medium and then created the surf of the waves with transparent and white silicone.  Initially I  have tried to harden the chains with UV resin but they are so tiny that uv resin  couldn't harden them enough and the chains were  bending. I also thought to place the sub/mines on different layers of resin but usually there is a visible line between the layers and I didn't want this. I then tried to put the chains inside the straw and then pour the resin. But the chain is so thin/ light that could not submerge keep straight inside the straw , it bended and stuck at the sides of the straw <U+0001F641>.  Finally I also thought to hung everything from the top with a tiny thread  (like I have done in my hot air balloon , jellyfish and galaxy videos) but the chains/mines were so tiny/light and it would be very difficult for them to sink inside the resin and keep straight only by gravity <U+0001F616>.So I have used cylinder resin stands for the first time in the hope that they would be invisible once inside the epoxy resin.  Unfortunately, they are a little visible so this idea didn’t work out very well. I think next time I will reduce the diameter of the stands in the lathe as much as possible. Probably if they are very thin this will make them invisible but of course I will not know for sure until I try this. I guess many times we learn through trial and error and that’s ok by me.<U+0001F60A>I hope that you will enjoy this DIY video.Until next time I wish you all the best,4THECRAFTFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/4thecraft-56...INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/4thecraft/ Pinterest: https://gr.pinterest.com/4thecraft/ Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/4thecraftMUSIC1.

"The Chance to become a Mother - Dean Schneider - YouTube"	"ibmwsSetbBw"	"Dean Schneider"	"/channel/UCIsz3XD8_E1ebhE4YScWeJg"	1080000	"I‘ve spent a lot of time thinking about this Moment for the past few Months and even though it felt wrong I always came to the conclusion to sterilize Nayla before she has her first litter! But when the Vet arrived I knew if we do it NOW there is no going back anymore! We are not into trading animals, we are closed to the public (no Tourism) and have lots of natural african property! The Hakuna Mipaka Pride has a life-long and wild home here at the HM Oasis and I am not taking in any further Lions anymore. So in the end of the Day, it’s only going to be Nayla, Kiara, Khaleesi, Dexter, Snow & Leo which are going to have 300 hectares (3Million sqm) of pure african nature to roam, play, hunt and life a beautiful life! Extending this pride with a few more family members will increase their success in hunting and give the pride more natural responsibilities and social interaction with one another.Besides this I couldn‘t look into Naylas Eyes anymore knowing that I decided to take her ability away to become a mother before she even had the chance to give it a try! In this Case i‘m just letting nature be nature as far as the Environment and space on the Hakuna Mipaka allows.The Chance to become a Mother - Dean SchneiderSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneiderFollow Dean Schneider:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider Tiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.o... Official Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ Support Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donatio...About Dean Schneider: I am a 27-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I’m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet’s wildlife over the past two years!Born in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.Even though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka:The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don’t cater to tourists and don’t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don’t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.#DeanSchneider #FORMAT #VIDEOSPECIFIC"	54557	243	580442	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ibmwsSetbBw/hqdefault.jpg"	"dean schneider, dean schneider youtube, youtube dean schneider, animals, nature, wildlife, vlog, compilation, Wildlife animals, wild animals, animal compilat..."

"The Chance to become a Mother - Dean Schneider - YouTube"	"ibmwsSetbBw"	"Dean Schneider"	"/channel/UCIsz3XD8_E1ebhE4YScWeJg"	1080000	"I‘ve spent a lot of time thinking about this Moment for the past few Months and even though it felt wrong I always came to the conclusion to sterilize Nayla before she has her first litter! But when the Vet arrived I knew if we do it NOW there is no going back anymore! We are not into trading animals, we are closed to the public (no Tourism) and have lots of natural african property! The Hakuna Mipaka Pride has a life-long and wild home here at the HM Oasis and I am not taking in any further Lions anymore. So in the end of the Day, it’s only going to be Nayla, Kiara, Khaleesi, Dexter, Snow & Leo which are going to have 300 hectares (3Million sqm) of pure african nature to roam, play, hunt and life a beautiful life! Extending this pride with a few more family members will increase their success in hunting and give the pride more natural responsibilities and social interaction with one another.Besides this I couldn‘t look into Naylas Eyes anymore knowing that I decided to take her ability away to become a mother before she even had the chance to give it a try! In this Case i‘m just letting nature be nature as far as the Environment and space on the Hakuna Mipaka allows.The Chance to become a Mother - Dean SchneiderSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneiderFollow Dean Schneider:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider Tiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.o... Official Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ Support Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donatio...About Dean Schneider: I am a 27-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I’m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet’s wildlife over the past two years!Born in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.Even though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka:The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don’t cater to tourists and don’t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don’t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.#DeanSchneider #FORMAT #VIDEOSPECIFIC"	54557	243	580442	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ibmwsSetbBw/hqdefault.jpg"	"dean schneider, dean schneider youtube, youtube dean schneider, animals, nature, wildlife, vlog, compilation, Wildlife animals, wild animals, animal compilat..."

"Rabbit learns he is adopted - YouTube"	"sxGKgndSfCE"	"OneMorePlease"	"/channel/UCITMs6XgJVhSxUXNArIA2Kw"	603000	"A free roam rabbit/free range rabbit sleeping. When the rabbit sleeps, the rabbit often dreams. Pipkin rabbit eats, runs, and jumps in his dream, and his sleeping body does the same. After the rabbit is told he is adopted, he wakes up, makes a ferocious yawn, and sneezes, and allows himself to be pet. Waking a sleeping rabbit by telling him he is adopted may not sound very nice. However, Pipkin is a tiny pet bunny rabbit who loves waking up humans. So, every once in awhile, we wake him up. The rabbit has been woken with a rabbit air horn and a rabbit firecracker. When the rabbit is sleeping he often dreams of eating something, or doing one of his rabbit eating ASMR videos. When the rabbit eats in his dream, he sleeps soundly, and it takes more effort to get the rabbit to wake up. Here the rabbit is fast asleep, until he learns he is adopted!Maybe you saw our waking a sleeping rabbit with an air horn video, or waking a sleeping rabbit with a firecracker video or waking a sleeping rabbit with a guitar video. This is the same idea, just WAY more intense.Again, don't worry that we woke up the sleeping rabbit with the shocking news. The rabbit takes about 20 naps a day, and the rabbit wakes up at the quietest opening of the refrigerator door. Pipkin is always ready to make a rabbit eating ASMR video - so even when he is asleep, he is vigilant for sounds someone might feed him, as the rabbit loves eating fresh fruits and vegetables!When the rabbit is sleeping and dreaming, you can hear the rabbit smacking his lips and licking his lips. Watching him and listening to the rabbit sleep can be very calming. The sounds the cute rabbit makes can be relaxing, too. The rabbit sleeps out in the open usually. However, later at night, or for an afternoon nap, he likes to cuddle on the couch. Oftentimes he falls into the REM sleep, where he dreams and moves about. He is a free range rabbit, or free roam rabbit, and he has free range of the house. Maybe that's why the rabbit always likes to sleep out in the open, in the middle of the room or under the futon. Ha! Silly rabbit!Thanks for checking out Pipkin and our rabbit channel. We hope you think this is the cutest rabbit video ever, because he really enjoyed making this video!

"The Chance to become a Mother - Dean Schneider - YouTube"	"ibmwsSetbBw"	"Dean Schneider"	"/channel/UCIsz3XD8_E1ebhE4YScWeJg"	1080000	"I‘ve spent a lot of time thinking about this Moment for the past few Months and even though it felt wrong I always came to the conclusion to sterilize Nayla before she has her first litter! But when the Vet arrived I knew if we do it NOW there is no going back anymore! We are not into trading animals, we are closed to the public (no Tourism) and have lots of natural african property! The Hakuna Mipaka Pride has a life-long and wild home here at the HM Oasis and I am not taking in any further Lions anymore. So in the end of the Day, it’s only going to be Nayla, Kiara, Khaleesi, Dexter, Snow & Leo which are going to have 300 hectares (3Million sqm) of pure african nature to roam, play, hunt and life a beautiful life! Extending this pride with a few more family members will increase their success in hunting and give the pride more natural responsibilities and social interaction with one another.Besides this I couldn‘t look into Naylas Eyes anymore knowing that I decided to take her ability away to become a mother before she even had the chance to give it a try! In this Case i‘m just letting nature be nature as far as the Environment and space on the Hakuna Mipaka allows.The Chance to become a Mother - Dean SchneiderSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneiderFollow Dean Schneider:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider Tiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.o... Official Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ Support Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donatio...About Dean Schneider: I am a 27-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I’m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet’s wildlife over the past two years!Born in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.Even though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka:The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don’t cater to tourists and don’t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don’t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.#DeanSchneider #FORMAT #VIDEOSPECIFIC"	54557	243	580442	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ibmwsSetbBw/hqdefault.jpg"	"dean schneider, dean schneider youtube, youtube dean schneider, animals, nature, wildlife, vlog, compilation, Wildlife animals, wild animals, animal compilat..."

Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I’m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet’s wildlife over the past two years!Born in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.Even though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka:The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don’t cater to tourists and don’t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don’t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans.

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d..."	436031	4662	4991333	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9QiE-M1LrZk/hqdefault.jpg"	"dopamine detox, dopamine, dopamine fast, tricking my brain, hard things, enjoy hard things, enjoy difficult things, better than yesterday, motivation, self i..."

We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don’t cater to tourists and don’t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don’t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.#DeanSchneider #FORMAT #VIDEOSPECIFIC"	54557	243	580442	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ibmwsSetbBw/hqdefault.jpg"	"dean schneider, dean schneider youtube, youtube dean schneider, animals, nature, wildlife, vlog, compilation, Wildlife animals, wild animals, animal compilat..."

"The Chance to become a Mother - Dean Schneider - YouTube"	"ibmwsSetbBw"	"Dean Schneider"	"/channel/UCIsz3XD8_E1ebhE4YScWeJg"	1080000	"I‘ve spent a lot of time thinking about this Moment for the past few Months and even though it felt wrong I always came to the conclusion to sterilize Nayla before she has her first litter! But when the Vet arrived I knew if we do it NOW there is no going back anymore! We are not into trading animals, we are closed to the public (no Tourism) and have lots of natural african property! The Hakuna Mipaka Pride has a life-long and wild home here at the HM Oasis and I am not taking in any further Lions anymore. So in the end of the Day, it’s only going to be Nayla, Kiara, Khaleesi, Dexter, Snow & Leo which are going to have 300 hectares (3Million sqm) of pure african nature to roam, play, hunt and life a beautiful life! Extending this pride with a few more family members will increase their success in hunting and give the pride more natural responsibilities and social interaction with one another.Besides this I couldn‘t look into Naylas Eyes anymore knowing that I decided to take her ability away to become a mother before she even had the chance to give it a try! In this Case i‘m just letting nature be nature as far as the Environment and space on the Hakuna Mipaka allows.The Chance to become a Mother - Dean SchneiderSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneiderFollow Dean Schneider:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider Tiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.o... Official Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ Support Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donatio...About Dean Schneider: I am a 27-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I’m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet’s wildlife over the past two years!Born in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.Even though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka:The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity!

There is also the internal confidence you feel which is how comfortable you are in any given situation.In this video, we’re going to analyze what Don can teach us about both levels of confidence, and how mastering each level can take you from being nervous to completely confident in any situation.<U+23F0>TIMESTAMPS<U+23F0> 0:41 - Lesson #1: His relaxed body language.2:58 - Lesson #2: Don is non-reactive.5:18 - Lesson #3: He doesn’t try to convince other people.6:57 - Lesson #4: The belief that he will be okay, no matter what.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#DonDraper #CharismaOnCommand #Confidence--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Connect With Us Further:Website: http://www.charismaoncommand.comFacebook: http://facebook.com/charismaoncommandInstagram: @CharismaOnCommandOr if you want to see our personal stuff (regular life + playing music):Instagram: @CharlieHoupertInstagram: @IamBenAltman"	153841	3470	6267354	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/KmOAznOQX-g/hqdefault.jpg"	"charisma on command, charismaoncommand, charlie houpert, coc, charisma, charisma on command confidence, don draper, don draper confidence, how to become conf..."

Official Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ Support Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donatio...About Dean Schneider: I am a 27-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I’m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet’s wildlife over the past two years!Born in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.Even though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka:The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don’t cater to tourists and don’t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don’t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.#DeanSchneider #FORMAT #VIDEOSPECIFIC"	54560	243	580552	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ibmwsSetbBw/hqdefault.jpg"	"dean schneider, dean schneider youtube, youtube dean schneider, animals, nature, wildlife, vlog, compilation, Wildlife animals, wild animals, animal compilat..."

After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka:The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don’t cater to tourists and don’t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don’t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.#DeanSchneider #FORMAT #VIDEOSPECIFIC"	54561	243	580552	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ibmwsSetbBw/hqdefault.jpg"	"dean schneider, dean schneider youtube, youtube dean schneider, animals, nature, wildlife, vlog, compilation, Wildlife animals, wild animals, animal compilat..."

I love anything vocal/singing related and geek out on it every day.  I want to motivate and inspire others to follow their dreams…corny? Well maybe but it’s true. So what’s motivating me?? I had a huge tumour removed summer 2017 and my ovaries and fallopian tubes. The tumour was the size of a 20 week baby!!  However, despite not being able to walk for a couple of weeks, and feeling generally awful…. It has made me create and do what I love! It wasn’t an easy time but I won’t let fear dictate my life. I didn’t think ‘why me’, there are plenty of horrific issues people have to deal with…it’s not always smooth sailing.  It’s true when you hear, ‘Life is short’, the crazy thing is, I am glad it happened…I appreciate life even more and practice gratitude everyday…It’s so easy to get caught up with the little things…and I do sometimes, but look at the bigger picture, will it matter in a year or two…? Also thank you for all your support. It means a lot.

"The Chance to become a Mother - Dean Schneider - YouTube"	"ibmwsSetbBw"	"Dean Schneider"	"/channel/UCIsz3XD8_E1ebhE4YScWeJg"	1080000	"I‘ve spent a lot of time thinking about this Moment for the past few Months and even though it felt wrong I always came to the conclusion to sterilize Nayla before she has her first litter! But when the Vet arrived I knew if we do it NOW there is no going back anymore! We are not into trading animals, we are closed to the public (no Tourism) and have lots of natural african property! The Hakuna Mipaka Pride has a life-long and wild home here at the HM Oasis and I am not taking in any further Lions anymore. So in the end of the Day, it’s only going to be Nayla, Kiara, Khaleesi, Dexter, Snow & Leo which are going to have 300 hectares (3Million sqm) of pure african nature to roam, play, hunt and life a beautiful life! Extending this pride with a few more family members will increase their success in hunting and give the pride more natural responsibilities and social interaction with one another.Besides this I couldn‘t look into Naylas Eyes anymore knowing that I decided to take her ability away to become a mother before she even had the chance to give it a try! In this Case i‘m just letting nature be nature as far as the Environment and space on the Hakuna Mipaka allows.The Chance to become a Mother - Dean SchneiderSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneiderFollow Dean Schneider:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider Tiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.o... Official Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ Support Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donatio...About Dean Schneider: I am a 27-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I’m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet’s wildlife over the past two years!Born in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.Even though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka:The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity!

"The Chance to become a Mother - Dean Schneider - YouTube"	"ibmwsSetbBw"	"Dean Schneider"	"/channel/UCIsz3XD8_E1ebhE4YScWeJg"	1080000	"I‘ve spent a lot of time thinking about this Moment for the past few Months and even though it felt wrong I always came to the conclusion to sterilize Nayla before she has her first litter! But when the Vet arrived I knew if we do it NOW there is no going back anymore! We are not into trading animals, we are closed to the public (no Tourism) and have lots of natural african property! The Hakuna Mipaka Pride has a life-long and wild home here at the HM Oasis and I am not taking in any further Lions anymore. So in the end of the Day, it’s only going to be Nayla, Kiara, Khaleesi, Dexter, Snow & Leo which are going to have 300 hectares (3Million sqm) of pure african nature to roam, play, hunt and life a beautiful life! Extending this pride with a few more family members will increase their success in hunting and give the pride more natural responsibilities and social interaction with one another.Besides this I couldn‘t look into Naylas Eyes anymore knowing that I decided to take her ability away to become a mother before she even had the chance to give it a try! In this Case i‘m just letting nature be nature as far as the Environment and space on the Hakuna Mipaka allows.The Chance to become a Mother - Dean SchneiderSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneiderFollow Dean Schneider:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider Tiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.o... Official Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ Support Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donatio...About Dean Schneider: I am a 27-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I’m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet’s wildlife over the past two years!Born in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.Even though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.After starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! About Hakuna Mipaka:The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.The Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don’t cater to tourists and don’t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don’t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.#DeanSchneider #FORMAT #VIDEOSPECIFIC"	54564	243	580552	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ibmwsSetbBw/hqdefault.jpg"	"dean schneider, dean schneider youtube, youtube dean schneider, animals, nature, wildlife, vlog, compilation, Wildlife animals, wild animals, animal compilat..."
