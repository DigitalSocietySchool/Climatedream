"Is Al Gore Misrepresenting Global Warming? - Patrick Michaels - YouTube"	"tYeSo7VHdag"	"FORA.tv"	"/channel/UCnzItcpd7WGVn80TRRb8RcQ"	115000	"Complete video at: http://fora.tv/2009/03/12/Climate_of_...Patrick Michaels argues that, when discussing climate change, \"people accept the strangest things without really fact checking.\" Michaels argues that many of Al Gore's claims and presumptions about global warming are false.-----There's a whole new world of global warming science today-but few ever hear about it. In recent years, an internally consistent body of scientific literature has emerged that argues cogently for global warming but against the gloom-and-doom, apocalyptic vision of climate change.Not that you would know. Consult the daily newspaper or evening newscast: dire predictions are nearly all we see or hear.In their new book, \"Climate of Extremes\", coauthors Patrick J. Michaels and Robert C. Balling Jr. illuminate the other side of the story, the science we arent being told. This body of work details how the impact of global warming is far less severe than is generally believed and far from catastrophic. However, because it is not infused with horrific predictions and angst about the future, regardless of its quality it is largely repressed and ignored.This in-depth exploration illustrates the crucial unreported forecasts: that changes in hurricanes will be small, that global warming is likely to be modest, and that contrary to daily headlines, there is no apocalypse on the horizon - Cato Institute Pat Michaels is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a research professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia. He is a past president of the American Association of State Climatologists and was program chair for the Committee on Applied Climatology of the American Meteorological Society. Michaels is a contributing author and reviewer of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He was an author of the 2003 climate science \"Paper of the Year\" awarded by the Association of American Geographers, for the demonstration that urban heat-related mortality declined significantly as cities became warmer. His writing has been published in the major scientific journals, including Climate Research, Climatic Change, Geophysical Research Letters, Journal of Climate, Nature, and Science; and his articles have appeared also in the Washington Post, the Washington Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, Houston Chronicle, and the Journal of Commerce."	211	36	19611	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/tYeSo7VHdag/hqdefault.jpg"

"Seven surprising results from the reduction of Arctic Sea ice cover | David Barber | TEDxUManitoba - YouTube"	"ofaoiHYKtlc"	"TEDx Talks"	"/channel/UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q"	24200000	"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. It is now well known that sea ice in the Arctic has changed in both extent and thickness over the past several decades. In fact the change in sea ice is seen as one of the key global climate variables confirming model estimates of global scale warming of our planet through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) process.  Extensive investigations at the leading edge of Arctic System Science have recently uncovered a number of surprises, many somewhat counterintuitive, each having significant consequences in the Arctic and through teleconnections to the rest of our planet.  In this talk I will review the rate and magnitude of change in sea ice, put this into the context of our understanding of the ‘natural variability’ in sea ice over the past several thousand years.  I will then review seven surprising impacts of this change: 1) increasing coverage of young ice significantly changes atmospheric chemistry; 2) more snow both preserves and destroys ice; 3) Polar bear habitat can actually improve in some areas while deteriorating in others; 4) match-mismatch timing in the marine ecosystem increases vulnerability; 5) uncertainty as to whether the Arctic ocean will increase or decrease in overall productivity is a key unknown; 6) evidence that ice hazards are actually increasing while the world marshals to increase development of Arctic resources; and 7) evidence that our recent cold winters are actually linked to our warming Arctic. Dr. Barber obtained his Bachelors and Masters from the University of Manitoba, and his Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo, Ontario.  He was appointed to a faculty position at the University of Manitoba in 1993 and received a Canada Research Chair in Arctic System Science in 2002.  He is currently Associate Dean (Research), CHR Faculty of Environment, Earth and Resources. Dr. Barber has extensive experience in the examination of the Arctic marine environment as a ‘system’, and the effect climate change has on this system. Dr. Barber has published over 200 articles in the peer-reviewed literature pertaining to sea ice, climate change and physical-biological coupling in the Arctic marine system. He led the largest International Polar Year project in the world, known as the Circumpolar Flaw Lead system study. He is recognized internationally through scientific leadership in large network programs such as NOW, CASES, ArcticNet, and the Canadian Research Icebreaker (Amundsen), as an invited member of several Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council national committees, international committees and invitations to national and international science meetings. Dr. Barber was instrumental in a national competition to bring a Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC) to the University of Manitoba in the field of Arctic Geomicrobiology and Climate Change.  As a member of the Centre for Earth Observation Science he leads a polar marine science group of over 100 peopleAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

The very word invokes an epic tale of Pharaohs and Israelites, plagues and miracles, the splitting of the sea, the drowning of an army, Moses and revelation. The story is at the very heart of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. After six years of research, working with archeologists, Egyptologists, geologists and theologians, Simcha Jacobovici came to the groundbreaking conclusion that the Exodus took place hundreds of years earlier than previously thought. With this new timetable in hand, Jacobovici and his colleagues re-examined long ignored archeological artifacts and uncovered the truth about the Exodus and the Egyptian dynasty that ruled at the time. The producers teamed up with some of the world’s most accomplished special effects designers to create a unique digital, organic experience of the Exodus. Blending archeological findings with modern eye catching effects, Jacobovici built a virtual museum to showcase his discoveries.Sign up to History Hit with code 'timeline' for 80% off http://bit.ly/TimelineSignUpContent licensed from Syndicado.

This change has been profoundly felt in how Americans interact with their government and how the government itself functions—or doesn’t—during this unprecedented crisis. After passing the multi-<U+200B>trillion-<U+200B>dollar COVID-19 relief package, House and Senate members left town, and legislative activity, including oversight hearings, ceased. Congress watchers have called on the House and Senate to resume most operations remotely, but can they? What are the practical, technological, and political obstacles to congressional remote operations? How can effective oversight be conducted from a distance?Join us as an expert panel examines these and other issues impacting the U.S. government’s “first branch.”"	1	1	NA	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/jVm1Gu8pSTM/hqdefault.jpg"

(featuring Richard Lindzen) - YouTube"	"3Xe5VeMYD7Y"	"The Cato Institute"	"/channel/UCyl7zwI6giPG6zC3uC8GGVg"	54300	"Follow the link below to watch the full event:http://www.cato.org/events/science-pr...Featuring Richard S. Lindzen, Distinguished Senior Fellow, Center for the Study of Science, Cato Institute; Emeritus Sloan Professor of Meteorology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; moderated by Patrick Michaels, Director, Center for the Study of Science, Cato Institute.For many fields of science, there is little doubt that the period 1830-1965 was a golden age. There is also little doubt that changes in the support structure for science since the late 60's have powerful elements that serve to inhibit major developments. Dr. Lindzen will discuss these changes from the personal perspective of a climate scientist, and place them in the historical perspective of other areas of study.Quantification of the effects of the support structure is complicated. There are a multiplicity of factors involved, including the existence of branches of science that are closely associated with political and social agendas. Changes in the character of major research centers, including the federalization of major research universities, also plays a major role, independent of the particular area of science. Serious studies of marginal factors such as diminishing returns as funding increases are sorely lacking.Video produced by Blair Gwaltney."	381	20	25390	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/3Xe5VeMYD7Y/hqdefault.jpg"

"Example Cambridge Law Admissions Interview - YouTube"	"npEcenV-Y08"	"Cambridge Law Faculty"	"/channel/UCKpz_4qERjwMB7oFMW1RmHw"	18900	"This video shows a mock admissions interview for the Cambridge BA Tripos Degree in Law, conducted at Trinity College, Cambridge in November 2017.This video is intended to give potential applicants an idea of what an interview might be like. The video is a typical, representative example of a Cambridge Law admissions interview – but please do not think of it as a model, perfect or ideal interview: exactly what a Law admissions interview looks like varies from college to college and from interviewer to interviewer. In this interview, two interviewers spend 20-25 minutes speaking with the candidate, Rhianna, who is a Cambridge undergraduate but not a Law student. Rhianna was given a page containing a short set of facts, together with information about the relevant law, 30 minutes before the interview. You can download the information which the candidate was given at: https://resources.law.cam.ac.uk/docum...Most Cambridge Law admissions interviews include an exercise related to law or related to more general moral or practical reasoning but, again, practice varies from college to college and interviewer to interviewer. Although the exercises often raise legal issues, or even involve the use of legal tests, candidates are not generally expected to have, and are not being tested on, any legal knowledge: if any law is required to complete the exercise, it will be provided. Even where candidates have indicated (on their application forms) that they have already studied some law – such as at A Level – we only expect them to know as much of the law as they have studied. Note that candidates coming to Cambridge for interview will also be required to sit the Cambridge Law Test (CLT); you can read more about the CLT and view some example papers at:  http://ba.law.cam.ac.uk/applying/camb..."	5730	181	559462	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/npEcenV-Y08/hqdefault.jpg"

By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence."	121	4	1226	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/htjFsDsi-zg/hqdefault.jpg"
