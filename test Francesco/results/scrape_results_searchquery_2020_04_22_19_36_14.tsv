According to Bill Nye, evolution is such a fundamental scientific truth that<U+0085>well, watch.If you dismiss evolution, Nye says, how can you get any of the followup questions right? The massive number of generations required for evolutionary changes make obvious the kind of time involved, lengthening the age of the earth from religion<U+0092>s few thousand years to science<U+0092>s billions of them. And that expanded view, argues Nye, makes so many other things make sense: If we<U+0092>ve only been around a little while, for example, what<U+0092>s the deal with those ancient dinosaur bones and fossils? A belief in deep time is so critical to our understanding of life, the earth, its processes, and the stars above us, that to deny it is to force oneself into settling for ever-more-implausible explanations of what we see around us.What<U+0092>s got Nye even more chagrined is that it<U+0092>s one thing to turn your own back on science, but when you pass that outlook on to your children, what<U+0092>s at risk is nothing less than the creation of a generation whose basic premise<U+0097>creationism<U+0097>leads to and answers that just get wronger and wronger. Brilliant young minds consigned to scientific failure from the start. We<U+0092>d hope for better from educators and parents. Just imagine the things these fresh, inquisitive minds could discover someday.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BILL NYEBill Nye, scientist, engineer, comedian, author, and inventor, is a man with a mission: to help foster a scientifically literate society, to help people everywhere understand and appreciate the science that makes our world work. Making science entertaining and accessible is something Bill has been doing most of his life.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ABOUT BIG THINK:Smarter Faster<U+0099>Big Think is the leading source of expert-driven, actionable, educational content -- with thousands of videos, featuring experts ranging from Bill Clinton to Bill Nye, we help you get smarter, faster.

How can we use literature as therapy during this moment of drastic change? In this live session with Harvard literature professor Lisa New, you<U+0092>ll dive into the world of prose and poetry, discovering the answer to questions like: how can I use reading as a coping mechanism? What do I lose when I only watch the movie and ignore the book? And why do people roll their eyes at poetry, anyway?
