He is recognized for innovative experimental work that led to a major advance in the understanding of superconductivity and to new scientific instruments. The Nancy DeLoye Fitzroy and Roland V. Fitzroy Medal, established in 2011, recognizes pioneering contributions to the frontiers of engineering that have led to a breakthrough in existing technology, or to new applications or new areas of engineering endeavor.Dr. Giaever earned a mechanical engineering degree from the Norwegian Institute of Technology before immigrating to Canada. He worked briefly at Canadian General Electric in Peterborough before moving to the U.S. to join GE in Schenectady, N.Y. After completing the company<U+0092>s engineering program, he was with General Electric Research Laboratory from 1958 to 1988.At GE, Dr. Giaever did research on superconductivity and electron tunneling while pursuing his doctorate in theoretical physics part time at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.  In 1965 he was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Physics Prize, and he was honored with a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 for his efforts on tunneling and superconductivity.In 1988 Dr. Giaever joined the faculty at RPI and was institute professor until 2004. He and Dr. Charles R. Keese formed Applied BioPhysics in 1991 to develop, commercialize and market ECIS<U+0099>, an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing technology they had invented while at GE, and other biophysical technologies.

Lindzen, Distinguished Senior Fellow, Center for the Study of Science, Cato Institute; Emeritus Sloan Professor of Meteorology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; moderated by Patrick Michaels, Director, Center for the Study of Science, Cato Institute.For many fields of science, there is little doubt that the period 1830-1965 was a golden age. There is also little doubt that changes in the support structure for science since the late 60's have powerful elements that serve to inhibit major developments. Dr. Lindzen will discuss these changes from the personal perspective of a climate scientist, and place them in the historical perspective of other areas of study.Quantification of the effects of the support structure is complicated. There are a multiplicity of factors involved, including the existence of branches of science that are closely associated with political and social agendas. Changes in the character of major research centers, including the federalization of major research universities, also plays a major role, independent of the particular area of science. Serious studies of marginal factors such as diminishing returns as funding increases are sorely lacking.Video produced by Blair Gwaltney."

Lindzen, Distinguished Senior Fellow, Center for the Study of Science, Cato Institute; Emeritus Sloan Professor of Meteorology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; moderated by Patrick Michaels, Director, Center for the Study of Science, Cato Institute.For many fields of science, there is little doubt that the period 1830-1965 was a golden age. There is also little doubt that changes in the support structure for science since the late 60's have powerful elements that serve to inhibit major developments.
