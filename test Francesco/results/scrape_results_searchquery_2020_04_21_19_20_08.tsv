Eleven years and a second film later he<U+0092>s become an even bigger energy hypocrite.VISIT Clear Energy Alliance https://clearenergyalliance.com/ FOLLOW us!Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ClearEnergyA... Twitter: https://twitter.com/clearenergy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/clearenergy... For list of sources and downloadable transcript: https://clearenergyalliance.com/proje...  Script:Practice what you preach. It<U+0092>s an admonition that we<U+0092>ve all heard sometime in our lives when we<U+0092>re acting like hypocrites. It makes me wonder if Al Gore<U+0092>s parents ever scolded him for preaching one thing while doing another.This question came to mind after the release of Gore<U+0092>s follow-up to <U+0093>An Inconvenient Truth.<U+0094> You see, after the original movie came out in 2006, Gore was lambasted for being a hypocrite. While Gore was predicting climate doom because we are all using too much energy, his own electric bills proved he was burning 20 times more electricity than the average American household.There<U+0092>s nothing more destructive to a crusader<U+0092>s cause than hypocrisy, so Gore jumped into action. He put 33 280-watt solar panels on his roof and among other improvements installed geo-thermal. It seemed he was serious because he spent a quarter million dollars on the renovation. Well<U+0085> that<U+0092>s the way it seemed, anyway.To coincide with the release of Gore<U+0092>s sequel, The National Center for Public Policy Research conduced a new study to see if Gore had stopped being a hypocrite. Guess what<U+0085> ten years later<U+0085> Al Gore is an even bigger energy hog!Gore is burning up not 20, but 34 times the electricity than the national average. The National Center discovered that from August 2016 through July 2017 Gore spent almost, get this, $22,000 on electricity bills for his posh Nashville home. Al uses so much electricity, all those solar panels provide less than 6 percent of his power consumption. And by the way, Gore owns at least two other large homes and they were not included in this analysis.Some folks want to give Gore a pass because his home is huge<U+0097>more than 10,000 square feet. But that argument doesn<U+0092>t hold up. Efficient homes use between five and ten kilowatt hours of electricity per square foot each year no matter how large or small. Gore<U+0092>s home uses 23.Doesn<U+0092>t it make you wonder what the heck is going on in there. Gore divorced his wife Tipper several years back and she lives in her own mansion in California. And Gore travels a lot, so the home is presumably empty a good percentage of the time. What<U+0092>s got that electric meter running so hard?Well, it<U+0092>s great fun pointing out Gore<U+0092>s astonishing hypocrisy, there<U+0092>s a more important point to be made here. Gore had to know his electricity bills would be scrutinized when the new film came out, yet he became an even bigger energy hog.What the former vice president<U+0092>s actions tell us is that it<U+0092>s more important for him to live the life of an energy-guzzling fat cat than it is to be a crusader who lives modestly so he actually has some credibility.Finally, and this is the most important fact of all, when Al Gore<U+0092>s term as vice president ended he was worth about two million bucks. He then focused all his attention on becoming the world<U+0092>s chief climate change alarmist. It was an extremely lucrative career move. He<U+0092>s now estimated to be worth $300 million dollars.So ask yourself. What<U+0092>s driving Al Gore? Is it really a sincere concern for the planet. Or, is sounding the alarm about climate change a great way to get rich?Power on, America."

He is recognized for innovative experimental work that led to a major advance in the understanding of superconductivity and to new scientific instruments. The Nancy DeLoye Fitzroy and Roland V. Fitzroy Medal, established in 2011, recognizes pioneering contributions to the frontiers of engineering that have led to a breakthrough in existing technology, or to new applications or new areas of engineering endeavor.Dr. Giaever earned a mechanical engineering degree from the Norwegian Institute of Technology before immigrating to Canada. He worked briefly at Canadian General Electric in Peterborough before moving to the U.S. to join GE in Schenectady, N.Y. After completing the company<U+0092>s engineering program, he was with General Electric Research Laboratory from 1958 to 1988.At GE, Dr. Giaever did research on superconductivity and electron tunneling while pursuing his doctorate in theoretical physics part time at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.  In 1965 he was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Physics Prize, and he was honored with a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 for his efforts on tunneling and superconductivity.In 1988 Dr. Giaever joined the faculty at RPI and was institute professor until 2004. He and Dr. Charles R. Keese formed Applied BioPhysics in 1991 to develop, commercialize and market ECIS<U+0099>, an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing technology they had invented while at GE, and other biophysical technologies.

Have any such predictions been established scientifically? Would massive <U+0093>carbon<U+0094> taxes and other controls put America and the world<U+0097>especially the poor<U+0097>at great risk?At this special event, geoscientist and astrophysicist Willie Soon separates fact from fiction in the global warming debate. He explains why the forecasts from CO2 climate models have been so wrong<U+0097>and why solar influences on clouds, oceans, and wind drive climate change, not CO2 emissions. Stanford University physicist Elliott Bloom then comments.<U+0093>The whole point of science is to question accepted dogmas. For that reason, I respect Willie Soon as a good scientist and a courageous citizen.<U+0094><U+0097>Freeman J. Dyson, Professor Emeritus of Physics, Institute for Advanced Study; Templeton Prize Laureate<U+0093>I am writing to express my deep admiration and respect for Dr. Willie Soon, a fine astrophysicist and human being.... As Willie has shown in many ways, observational facts do not fit the CO2 dogma, and an enormous amount of evidence points to the Sun as a much more important driver of climate.... Willie was right<U+0097>whatever the cause of changing temperature, the main driver cannot be the concentration of atmospheric CO2.<U+0094><U+0097>William Happer, Chairman, Presidential Committee on Climate Security; Cyrus Fogg Brackett Professor of Physics Emeritus, Princeton University; Member, National Academy of SciencesWillie Soon is a geophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He received his Ph.D. (with distinction) in aeronautical engineering from the University of Southern California, and he has been Astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory; Senior Scientist at the George C. Marshall Institute; Senior Visiting Fellow at the State Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Science at Xiamen University; and Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Putra Malaysia. The author of 90 scientific papers, he has IEEE received the Nuclear & Plasma Sciences Society Award, Rockwell Dennis Hunt Award, Smithsonian Institution Award, Courage in Defense of Science Award, Petr Beckmann Award for Courage and Achievement in Defense of Scientific Truth and Freedom, and Frederick Seitz Memorial Award. http://www.independent.org/aboutus/pe...Elliott D.
