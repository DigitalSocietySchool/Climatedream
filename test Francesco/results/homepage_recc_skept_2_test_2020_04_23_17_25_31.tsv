"G-Force, Jerk, and Passing Out In A Centrifuge - YouTube"	"DMKcO-T5Y4o"	"Tom Scott"	"/channel/UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A"	2460000	"Thanks to the Starrship team for arranging this! I'm also over on their channel, flying with the Blades: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWY3-... • At the Royal Air Force training centrifuge in Farnbrough, pilots learn how to avoid G-LOC: g-induced loss of consciousness. Let's talk about g-force, about jerk, and about how to keep circulation flowing to your brain.FAQs:* Isn't 3.6g a really low g-tolerance? *Yep. Turns out I would not qualify to be a fighter pilot. The average range for g-tolerance is 4-6; no-one was expecting me to pass out. The centrifuge team do not deliberately try to G-LOC people! To be fair, though, I'd done a few earlier runs with only minor effects.* What g was the RAF person at the start pulling? *That's Marcus, from the Starrship team, and he was successfully pulling 6.5g with the help of g-trousers: they plug into a compressed air source in the plane (and in the centrifuge) and act as a lower-body tourniquet to keep the blood up top. They are very effective.* Why did you shake and shudder when regaining consciousness? *Those are called \"myoclonic convulsions\", which is a fancy medical term for \"muscle jerks\", and they're a common side effect of recovering from G-LOC.* What did it feel like? *I'll answer this in more detail in a video over on the Matt and Tom channel soon, but in short: I don't remember it. I was doing the breathing maneuver, then everything was wobbly, then we were stopped!* Is this a sponsored video? *No: the RAF and Starrship had no editorial control over this, and no money changed hands. Obviously, though, they gave me a spin in the centrifuge, and I'm collaborating with them over on their channel too!THANKS TO: The RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine, the Starrship team, and the folks at Qinetiq.STARRSHIP:Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/starrshiphope/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/starrshiphope/Twitter: https://twitter.com/starrshiphopeI'm at http://tomscott.comon Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscotton Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscottand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"	75397	1640	5190895	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DMKcO-T5Y4o/hqdefault.jpg"

Philippine President Manuel Luis Quezon immediately took action and issued an official declaration condemning the Nazis, declaring that his country will distribute visas to Jewish immigrants. Against all odds, he succeeded in issuing 10,000 visas to European Jewry.President Quezon continued with his efforts and initiated the establishment of housing for Jewish immigrants, finding employment solutions, and even requisitioning farmland from his estate for their use. Temple Emil, the first synagogue in Manila, was established by him.In January 2017, Ilan Scolnik from the Friends of Zion Museum and H.E. Ambassador Nathaniel Imperial of the Philippines met at the Embassy to mark the enormous contribution of the Philippine people to the Jewish people and to the State of Israel, during the Second World War and up to the present day. A special message was recorded by The Ambassador calling for people throughout the world to stand with Israel and battle anti-Semitism. He stressed the importance of continuing the legacy that President Quezon began during World War II."	78	6	13649	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Sqoihgi-w3g/hqdefault.jpg"

However, his remarkable wit sometimes conceived remarkably poor reasoning, something often unnoticed by those drunk on his elegance.In this video, I take three typical examples of sophistic reasoning from Hitchens' various debates and speeches, and break them down to expose their flaws.It is unlikely that I will ever cease praising Hitchens as my favourite writer anytime soon; anybody unfamiliar with my work who lands on this video should know that I take deep inspiration from him.--------------------------------LINKS---------------------------------Galloway vs Hitchens debate: https://youtu.be/XLKQGwVkczg'Why Women Aren't Funny': https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/20...'Why Women Still Aren't Funny': https://youtu.be/I7izJggqCoA'That's your opinion': https://youtu.be/RvAe4UJZl0w?t=25Hitchens, Letter to a Young Contrarian (affiliate link): https://amzn.to/2JP4fMb[1] 'Christopher Hitchens - The morals of an atheist': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOHgr...[2] 'Best of Hitchslap Part 2': https://youtu.be/889eXqS_MtI?t=85 (taken from the debate, 'We'd be better off without religion': https://youtu.be/tWOZi_OUQL8)[3] 'Christopher Hitchens destroys the myth that morality comes from religion': https://youtu.be/iG-JLmc4Krw[4] 'Christopher Hitchens on Morality': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwaWJ...

You don't care about climate change right? Because it's a bunch words of things that don't affect your daily life. Think again. In this provocative talk, Saddington gives us a new lens on climate change. It's a game changer.Influencing UK government policy, establishing his own social enterprise and fronting a media campaign that reached over 3 million people are just a few of David’s achievements as a climate change activist since being impacted by a stark reminder of climate change as a teenager.From a meeting with then Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street, he discussed the implementation of climate change on the national curriculum. Climate change is now an essential part of youth education and he has pushed to expand these education reforms worldwide.As a Three Dot Dash Global Teen Leader, he has expanded his philanthropic and award-winning social enterprise, which has developed eco gardens across Northern England and within the historic grounds of Durham University.David has acted as an environmental consultant for countless organisations and is a regular commentator on contemporary climate issues within academic arenas and international media outlets. He has studied the science of climate change at Durham University for 3 years and led a groundbreaking glacier survey expedition to Vatnajökull, Iceland. His most recent venture transformed the medieval Market Square of Durham City into an outdoor cinema to showcase the award-winning documentary Chasing Ice. He then chaired ‘Climate Change Question Time,’ where the public could grill world leading climate experts on the science behind the headlines and how to tackle the problem.David believes that we must act as a species rather than via fragmented interests in order to tackle this remarkable global disruptor.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"	3008	2691	491616	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7vnzKPq390Q/hqdefault.jpg"

We need to establish ethical standards in dealing with artificial intelligence - and to answer the question: What still makes us as human beings unique?Mankind is still decades away from self-learning machines that are as intelligent as humans. But already today, chatbots, robots, digital assistants and other artificially intelligent entities exist that can emulate certain human abilities. Scientists and AI experts agree that we are in a race against time: we need to establish ethical guidelines before technology catches up with us.  While AI Professor Jürgen Schmidhuber predicts artificial intelligence will be able to control robotic factories in space, the Swedish-American physicist Max Tegmark warns against a totalitarian AI surveillance state, and the philosopher Thomas Metzinger predicts a deadly AI arms race. But Metzinger also believes that Europe in particular can play a pioneering role on the threshold of this new era: creating a binding international code of ethics.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

"Dr Jennifer Marohasy at Climate Change Concern Forum in Maroochydore - YouTube"	"dVlu-7_FxD8"	"Institute of Public Affairs"	"/channel/UC0VXp0q5i8o-CxL_8Q3HOtQ"	20600	"IPA Senior Fellow Dr Jennifer Marohasy addresses the Climate Change Concern Forum at the Maroochydore Surf Life Saving Club on 14 July 2019. In her discussion Dr Marohasy reveals that the corals at Heron Island remain constrained, just as they were in 1955 when her mother lived and worked on the Island. The growth of corals in 1955 were constrained by their inability to continue to grow-up, because sea levels were not rising. This continues to be the situation today — despite what you might to be told on the nightly news.In fact, a peer-reviewed technical paper by L. Scopelitis et al. published in the journal ‘Coral Reef’ in 2011 explains that the period 2002 to 2007 has been the most constrained for Heron Island corals since at least 1940 because they have reached their vertical limit for growth and there has been no sea level rise.  The single biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef is sea level fall. Sea levels did fall some 30 centimetres during the recent super El Nino event of 2015/2016 as explained in the presentation.  Filmed and edited by DRONEHACK.PRODUCTIONS.For more information visit Dr Marohasy's blog at www.jennifermarohasy.com or the IPA website at www.ipa.org.au."	531	87	24852	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/dVlu-7_FxD8/hqdefault.jpg"

I hope this letter finds you in good spirits as we navigate this truly surreal crisis. Since 2013, we at Letters Live have been inviting performers to bring letters to life in memorable venues around the world. With our ‘Read A Letter’ campaign, we’re opening the stage extremely wide and would love for the world (you!) to share letters to the heroes on the frontline; letters to relatives in need; letters to strangers who have stepped up and made a difference; letters to neighbouring families, streets, towns and countries; letters from teachers to their isolated pupils or to the parents who now find themselves home-schooling; letters to those in power; letters to a population crying out for words of comfort. You could record yourself reading an important letter you have wanted to send, or a cherished letter you once received. It could be a favourite letter of yours that offers hope in our current crisis or a prescient warning too important to be ignored. It may simply be a favourite letter of yours that may brighten everyone’s day. (I am obliged to say that if you’re not reading your own letter, you must, please, ask the letter writer’s permission.)  So, all you need to do is this: - Film yourself reading a letter. Use your phone, just as I am. - If you're camera shy, point your phone at something else while you read: the letter itself, the view from your window, your adorable dog. - Before you read the letter, tell us who it’s to and who it’s from, and if you can, tell us why you’ve chosen it. - Post the video to Twitter or Instagram or whichever corner of the internet you frequent, remembering to include the hashtag #ReadALetter and tag @letterslive so we can then share your reading. Alternatively, if you don't use social media, send the clip to read@letterslive.com so we can share the letter for you.- Spread the word by nominating another person to write a letter. That’s it. Thank you in advance for taking part. Stay connected. Stay safe. Stay at home. Yours in isolation, Benedict, and all at Letters Live"	6995	43	134507	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/noE6EMp2Kck/hqdefault.jpg"

By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.MB01LLZ2BKK4MNM"	1272	567	338498	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/j4QJO897378/hqdefault.jpg"

The Bernina railway sets a few records, including being the highest railway alpine crossing in Europe (2253m), the highest adhesion railway of the continent, the open air railway with the greatest height difference (1824m) and furthermore one of the steepest adhesion railways (conventional railway without cogs) worldwide, with gradients of up to 7%.A unique aspect of Switzerland's narrow gauge mountain railways is the mixing of passenger and freight wagons in a single train, with wagons often added or removed at intermediate stops with shunting locomotives. On the Bernina line, the cargo mostly consists of wood on stake cars and derivatives of oil in tank cars.At this point, I would like to thank Paolo for making this video possible and providing a great deal of information included in the video.

We need to establish ethical standards in dealing with artificial intelligence - and to answer the question: What still makes us as human beings unique?Mankind is still decades away from self-learning machines that are as intelligent as humans. But already today, chatbots, robots, digital assistants and other artificially intelligent entities exist that can emulate certain human abilities. Scientists and AI experts agree that we are in a race against time: we need to establish ethical guidelines before technology catches up with us.  While AI Professor Jürgen Schmidhuber predicts artificial intelligence will be able to control robotic factories in space, the Swedish-American physicist Max Tegmark warns against a totalitarian AI surveillance state, and the philosopher Thomas Metzinger predicts a deadly AI arms race. But Metzinger also believes that Europe in particular can play a pioneering role on the threshold of this new era: creating a binding international code of ethics.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

I hope this letter finds you in good spirits as we navigate this truly surreal crisis. Since 2013, we at Letters Live have been inviting performers to bring letters to life in memorable venues around the world. With our ‘Read A Letter’ campaign, we’re opening the stage extremely wide and would love for the world (you!) to share letters to the heroes on the frontline; letters to relatives in need; letters to strangers who have stepped up and made a difference; letters to neighbouring families, streets, towns and countries; letters from teachers to their isolated pupils or to the parents who now find themselves home-schooling; letters to those in power; letters to a population crying out for words of comfort. You could record yourself reading an important letter you have wanted to send, or a cherished letter you once received. It could be a favourite letter of yours that offers hope in our current crisis or a prescient warning too important to be ignored. It may simply be a favourite letter of yours that may brighten everyone’s day. (I am obliged to say that if you’re not reading your own letter, you must, please, ask the letter writer’s permission.)  So, all you need to do is this: - Film yourself reading a letter. Use your phone, just as I am. - If you're camera shy, point your phone at something else while you read: the letter itself, the view from your window, your adorable dog. - Before you read the letter, tell us who it’s to and who it’s from, and if you can, tell us why you’ve chosen it. - Post the video to Twitter or Instagram or whichever corner of the internet you frequent, remembering to include the hashtag #ReadALetter and tag @letterslive so we can then share your reading. Alternatively, if you don't use social media, send the clip to read@letterslive.com so we can share the letter for you.- Spread the word by nominating another person to write a letter. That’s it. Thank you in advance for taking part. Stay connected. Stay safe. Stay at home. Yours in isolation, Benedict, and all at Letters Live"	6996	43	134507	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/noE6EMp2Kck/hqdefault.jpg"
