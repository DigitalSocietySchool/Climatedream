"The Official Friends of Zion Museum Trailer - YouTube"	"P5AC6lOmsb0"	"Friends of Zion Museum"	"/channel/UCCA1gKtxstihNF9rNbvFtfQ"	NA	"This dramatic trailer provides a small, enticing example of an exciting, unique experience that awaits visitors to Israel’s newest and most unique museum – the Friends of Zion Museum in Jerusalem. The museum tells the story of the Jewish people’s origins and the promise to them of the Land of Israel – a promise that has been cherished through the generations by Jews and believing Christians. Operating with the latest in high technology, the museum uses videos, animation, three-dimensional techniques, surround sound, original music and special lighting effects to relate the stories of brave Christians who dreamt of the restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land and took courageous actions to enable it to become a reality in our day. It is a story that has never been told before in this challenging and sensual manner and is suited for audiences of all faiths and from all nations."

"Simcha at FOZ Museum in A Celebration of Life - YouTube"	"9QOlQjD6LcY"	"Friends of Zion Museum"	"/channel/UCCA1gKtxstihNF9rNbvFtfQ"	NA	"http://www.fozmuseum.com FOZ Museum was recently featured on the “Simcha A Celebration of Life” show on the South African Jewish TV channel, taking viewers on a comprehensive tour of the Friends of Zion Museum in Jerusalem, accompanied by commentary by the Museum's CEO, Michael Evans Jr., and Ilan Scolnik, the museum’s marketing and sales Director. From the opening scene of the breathtaking flyover tour of the Land of Israel to the final 3d production summing up the museum tour, the show illustrates the amazing high-technology techniques used to tell the story of non-Jewish dreamers and doers who contributed to the development of the modern miracle of Israel. The visitor to the museum actually gets to “meet” some of those people through various interactive technological techniques combining, animation, video, lighting, narration and music.  Michael Evens says in the presentation: “We wanted people to come here and go through a journey, to really feel that they were really part of that experience. We decided that the best way to do that would be to create a technological experience that pulls people into the journey and allows them to be a part of that story, so that when they leave this place, they take that story with them.”"	3	1	443	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9QOlQjD6LcY/hqdefault.jpg"

It needs to be remineralized and placed in a vortex to be restructured. 08:05 In the 1920s Rudolph Steiner said that the heart does not pump the blood. 12:15 Blood goes slower as it proceeds through the arteries until it gets to the capillaries where it stops, shimmies and gets going again. 16:07 Your heart does not have the force you would need to push blood through your blood vessels.20:07 The motive for movement is at the level of the capillaries. 03:39 There are 4 phases of water. The water in cells is in a gel phase. 24:46 The gel layer of your cells is always negatively charged, which means it has separated the charges. There are positive charges in the water inside the cell. The positive ions/protons repel each other and start the water flowing. 26:50 Water cannot go up a tube more than 33 feet before the pressure of the weight of the water is too heavy. 27:30 Xylem tubes in plants are lined with hydrophilic proteins that separate the charges, shifting fluid using the same method as your body uses to move blood up your veins. 28:20 A vein is a thin walled tube with hydrophilic surfaces that creates a gel layer. 29:12 Muscle contraction in the legs is not a primary mover, though it is a contributor.30:24 Your heart stops the blood. Incoming flow hits the cavity of the left ventricle which contains a valve. The heart holds the blood back a few milliseconds, converts the laminar flow into a vortex. 32:12 Your heart participates in the movement of the blood, but not because of a pushing of the walls. Movement comes from the movement of the blood.33:07 The heart is like a hydraulic ram. 33:45 The efficiency of the hydraulic ram is about 70%. Only 70% comes out each cycle. A pump must always work at 100% efficiency. The efficiency of the heart is 70%. 35:06 Congestive heart failure is when the blood stops moving forward and only a small percentage comes out. 35:17 Since the heart is not pumping, the problem in congestive heart failure is insufficient flow. 36:22 Hypertension and hypertrophy are not the disease, they are the compensation response and therapy. 37:50 Flow is increased with sunlight, direct contact with the earth, good diet, and increased exercise. 38:50 Earthing/grounding causes you to absorb negative ions, a sort of energy source. 41:44 Our ability to make gels is destabilized by the insults of modern life. 42:54 The vortex of blood created by your heart is like a tornado. Vortex is the creative form of life. 44:12 We ignore life force in today’s science. 50:41 Any plant takes water and structures it. 53:55 The structuring of water occurs naturally through the interaction of blood vessels and the natural energy sources that are freely available to us. 54:48 The flow through a hydrophilic tube increases when you place your hand upon it. 01:04:11 The traditional way to eat vegetables is wild and perennial. 01:16:42 Dr. Cowan’s favorite morning activity is going right out to the garden and spending hours there. 01:18:18 Dr. Cowan’s desert island nutrient is eggs. 01:18:58 Dr. Cowan’s elevator pitch is that any form of coercion (ie: going to school, paying taxes, getting vaccinated) is the opposite of freedom."	3105	200	94029	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZFUomLdn9aQ/hqdefault.jpg"

It will be broadcast in mid-2015, details to come. The filming took me to the most radioactive places on Earth (and some places, which surprisingly aren't as radioactive as you'd think). Chernobyl and Fukushima were incredible to see as they present post-apocalyptic landscapes. I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.Notes about measuring radiation:Sieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.Obviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.https://xkcd.com/radiation/DOSES MAY VARYThe level of radiation varies widely around the world depending mainly on altitude and geology (excluding nuclear accidents).Estimates of particular doses also vary. All numbers reported in this video should be taken as order of magnitude only.The most contentious claim may be that smokers receive the highest dose of ionizing radiation. This is not a whole body dose, but a dose to the lungs as specified in the video.

We have created a Eurovision AI song that celebrates Eurovision – its melodrama, kitsch and camp, its humor and its gimmicks. The result is comprised entirely of material written and composed by Artificial Intelligence, titled \"Blue Jeans & Bloody Tears\". The project team fed hundreds of Eurovision songs – melodies and lyrics – into a neuron network. Then, algorithms produced thousands of new tunes and lines of verse, from which a few musical units were carefully selected and “welded” into a song.We hope this song will become the Eurovision unofficial anthem of Eurovision 2019. A duet on disillusioned love between Izhar Cohen (Israel's first Eurovision winner, 1978) and a computer, written and composed by a computer. The song was produced by Avshalom Ariel - one of the creators of TOY (Eurovision song winner, 2018)Lyrics:I am lost when i’m with youThere’s no hesitation in your eyesBaby bye bye byeOh bye bye byeBaby by myself the staingrows more obviousIn this pain of the bird who’s flyingOver roses of sadnessBaby bye bye byeOh bye bye byeBaby summer’s goneIt’s gone for the both of usAnd tears will always have wet eyesI’ll cry but I'll surviveOn a missionI will let you go foreverBlue jeans and bloody tearsBlue jeans and bloody tearsThere’s no life without your life in miseryBlue jeans and bloody tearsDon’t give up on a precious summerRolling in the moonshineBaby by bye-byeOh by bye-byeBaby let me goSo close to the holy groundTears will always have wet eyesI’ll cry but I'll surviveOn a missionI will let you go foreverBlue jeans and bloody tearsBlue jeans and bloody tearsThere’s no life without your life in miseryBlue jeans and bloody tearsDon’t break my heart - It’s powerlessThis magic is in spite of meDon’t keep me hanging onDon’t break my heart - It’s powerlessThis magic is in spite of meDon’t keep me hanging onkeep me hanging onkeep me hanging onI will let you go foreverBlue jeans and bloody tearsBlue jeans and bloody tearsBlue jeans and bloody tearsThere’s no life without your life in miseryBlue jeans and bloody tearsBlue jeans and bloody tearsBlue jeans and bloody tearsThere’s no life without your life in miseryBlue jeans and bloody tearsConcept and Creative direction by Nimrod (Nim) Shapira (nimshap.com)Construction and Production by Allenby Concept House (allenby.co.il)Co-produced by Nimrod (Nim) ShapiraSong production:Song Curation by Amir Shoenfeld Song Production by Avshalom ArielAdditional song curation by Ben Scheflan, Nim Shapira, Avshalom Ariel and Eran HadasBackground vocals by Avshalom Ariel and Ben Scheflan Mix by Omer SchonbergerMastering by Jonathan JacobiRecorded at Jaffa Sound ArtsMusic video team:Directed by Karni and Saul @ Sulkybunny (sulkybunny.com)Title design by Adam BlufarbIllustrations by Eliran BichmanDeep Learning team:Lyrics generation by Eran HadasAI and ML Team: Oracle Innovation and Oracle CloudAsaf Sobol - Senior Business Development leader, Oracle IsraelAndy Welch - Innovation engineer, Lead data scientist, Oracle UKAsaf Lev - Senior Innovation engineer, Oracle UK, Ireland & IsraelDavid Cottee - Senior Director of Innovation, Oracle UK, Ireland & Israel Midi conversion and Music consultation by Micha GiladAdditional Midi conversion by Ann StreichmanLegal consultancy: Attorneys Sally Gillis and Shirley Gal from Eitan, Mehulal, Sadot.Public relations:POSITIVE CommunicationsYuval HaringSpecial thanks to Oracle EMEA PR teamMaking of team:Directed and Edited by Nitay DaganCinematography by Stephan Stelman and Omri DaganSpecial Thanks: Ronen Harten, Nadav Hekselman, Elad Zakai, Eyal Linur, Roy Kafri, Lior Zalmanson, Shine Horovits, Tamir Leibovich, Mysh Rozanov, Sagi James Shahar, Gal Shaya, Tamar Scheflan, Vico Shaharabani, Aner Baruch, Omri Anghel, Ran Menachem, Eran-Shushu Spanier, Udi Ben-Arie, Cheli Menashe, Roy Hollander, Oren Solo, Einat Hirsch, Bella Faylayev, Nirit Green, Alessandro Zanoni, Baruch and Tehila Shapira, Efrat and Itay Gdor, Yuval Shapira and Yaara Gdor"	193949	4343	4097384	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4MKAf6YX_7M/hqdefault.jpg"

In her statement of claim (which I read in its totality in this video), Shepherd notes that her mistreatment continued unabated at Wilfred Laurier, despite the university's hypothetical apology and offer to mend its ways. She also claimed that she has been rendered unemployable as an academic (a claim I believe, having served on many university search committees, and knowing full well that any whiff of scandal is enough to disquality a candidate entirely). I talked to her lawyer after reading her claim, and decided that I would also pursue Wilfred Laurier and the professors and administrators directly responsible for this debacle.I am not convinced that Wilfred Laurier learned what needed to be learned even after being dragged through the national and international press, in what was the biggest scandal that ever hit a Canadian university. Maybe two lawsuits will help rectify that. We'll see. NOTE: The allegations in these statements of claim are simply that, at this stage. They have not been tested in a court of law, and cannot therefore be considered proved. --- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---Direct Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donateMerchandise: teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson--- BOOKS ---12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-...Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-m...--- LINKS ---Website: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/Blog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/Podcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/Reading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/Twitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpetersonInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.pe...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpete...--- PRODUCTS ---Personality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/perso...Self Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/Understand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/Merchandise: teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson"	43875	671	1349638	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/PkNv4LFpGf4/hqdefault.jpg"

Berlinski, who describes himself as a secular Jew and an agnostic takes the position that a society absent religious influence is not the kind of place where most of us would want to live.So the question stands: Is a purely secular society preferable to a religious one? Ultimately, this is a question of importance to everyone. Whether a given society is with or without a religious influence affects people of all persuasions, not just Christians and atheists.Free study guide at http://fixed-point.org/"	4158	255	333430	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/MBZXqsC89RY/hqdefault.jpg"

First add sand to the plate then begin playing a tone. Certain frequencies vibrate the metal plate in such a way that it creates areas where there is no vibration. The sand \"falls\" into those areas, creating beautiful geometric patterns. As the frequency increases in pitch the patterns become more complex.

He worked for the \"The Young Turks” TV show. ---------Don't miss a single video from Stossel TV, sign up here:  https://johnstossel.activehosted.com/f/1Subscribe to my YouTube channel: http://youtube.com/johnstosselLike me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JohnStossel/Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/johnstossel---------But Rubin tells John Stossel how he gradually changed his mind and became a classical liberal. For that, Rubin lost friends and gets protested at college campuses.While many leftists are so angry at Rubin, they will no longer talk to him, conservatives are eager to talk. Rubin says that surprised him because, \"I’m pro-choice. Most of them are pro-life. I’m against the death penalty, most of them are for the death penalty.\"Stossel had a similar experience: \"when I went from left to libertarian, the right was willing to argue,\" he tells Rubin.Why would that be? Rubin speculates that it comes down to treating people as individuals rather than groups. “If you believe in the individual, then you fundamentally understand that individuals are different. So you are willing to sit down with someone different than you,\" he says.Rubin gets flak for talking with right-wing provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos, and for criticizing leftists.  When Rubin tried to give a speech at the University of New Hampshire, a gender studies professor screamed: \"we don’t want you in the LGBT community (Rubin is gay), so get the f*** out.\" Another woman at the speech said Rubin is insensitive to victims. But when Rubin asked how she had been oppressed, she responded, \"I have no reason to tell you about my oppression because that’s just like mental energy, unless I’m going to be paid.\"Rubin calls the atmosphere on many campuses an \"Oppression Olympics\", where students and faculty compete to be the biggest victim. As a result, ideas that offend \"victims\" are often off limits for discussion.But Rubin says will not bow to political correctness.  He'll keep discussing uncomfortable ideas: \"I would rather live and stand for whatever I believe in than just bow forever.\""	38509	464	1019959	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/kl0-n0zWVJk/hqdefault.jpg"

"Christopher Hitchens vs. David Berlinski | Does Atheism Poison Everything? Debate - YouTube"	"MBZXqsC89RY"	"Fixed Point Foundation"	"/channel/UCwX4yZNZJJfFvTuvjJLMcVA"	18500	"In front of a sold-out crowd of 1,200 in Birmingham, Alabama, Christopher Hitchens, famed atheist and author of \"God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything,\" debates Dr. David Berlinski, Paris mathematician and author of \"The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions.\"Hitchens and others of the New Atheism movement have called for the annihilation of religion in order to establish a purely secular society. Berlinski, who describes himself as a secular Jew and an agnostic takes the position that a society absent religious influence is not the kind of place where most of us would want to live.So the question stands: Is a purely secular society preferable to a religious one? Ultimately, this is a question of importance to everyone. Whether a given society is with or without a religious influence affects people of all persuasions, not just Christians and atheists.Free study guide at http://fixed-point.org/"	4158	255	333430	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/MBZXqsC89RY/hqdefault.jpg"

I'm also over on their channel, flying with the Blades: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWY3-... • At the Royal Air Force training centrifuge in Farnbrough, pilots learn how to avoid G-LOC: g-induced loss of consciousness. Let's talk about g-force, about jerk, and about how to keep circulation flowing to your brain.FAQs:* Isn't 3.6g a really low g-tolerance? *Yep. Turns out I would not qualify to be a fighter pilot. The average range for g-tolerance is 4-6; no-one was expecting me to pass out. The centrifuge team do not deliberately try to G-LOC people! To be fair, though, I'd done a few earlier runs with only minor effects.* What g was the RAF person at the start pulling? *That's Marcus, from the Starrship team, and he was successfully pulling 6.5g with the help of g-trousers: they plug into a compressed air source in the plane (and in the centrifuge) and act as a lower-body tourniquet to keep the blood up top. They are very effective.* Why did you shake and shudder when regaining consciousness? *Those are called \"myoclonic convulsions\", which is a fancy medical term for \"muscle jerks\", and they're a common side effect of recovering from G-LOC.* What did it feel like? *I'll answer this in more detail in a video over on the Matt and Tom channel soon, but in short: I don't remember it. I was doing the breathing maneuver, then everything was wobbly, then we were stopped!* Is this a sponsored video? *No: the RAF and Starrship had no editorial control over this, and no money changed hands. Obviously, though, they gave me a spin in the centrifuge, and I'm collaborating with them over on their channel too!THANKS TO: The RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine, the Starrship team, and the folks at Qinetiq.STARRSHIP:Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/starrshiphope/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/starrshiphope/Twitter: https://twitter.com/starrshiphopeI'm at http://tomscott.comon Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscotton Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscottand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"	75394	1640	5190704	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/DMKcO-T5Y4o/hqdefault.jpg"
