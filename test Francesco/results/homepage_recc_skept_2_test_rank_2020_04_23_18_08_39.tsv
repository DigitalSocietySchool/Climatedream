"AlphaGo - The Movie | Full Documentary - YouTube"	"WXuK6gekU1Y"	"DeepMind"	"/channel/UCP7jMXSY2xbc3KCAE0MHQ-A"	192000	"With more board configurations than there are atoms in the universe, the ancient Chinese game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka, AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?"	22057	356	738879	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/WXuK6gekU1Y/hqdefault.jpg"	1

"Roger Penrose - Forbidden crystal symmetry in mathematics and architecture - YouTube"	"th3YMEamzmw"	"The Royal Institution"	"/channel/UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw"	759000	"Sir Roger Penrose provides a unique insight into the \"forbidden symmetry\" of his famous penrose tiles and the use of non-repeating patterns in design and architecture. It is a rigorous mathematical theorem that the only crystallographic symmetries are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetries.Yet, since the 1970s 5-fold, 8-fold, 10-fold and 12-fold \"almost\" symmetric patterns have been exhibited, showing that such crystallographically \"forbidden symmetries\" are mathematically possible and deviate from exact symmetry by an arbitrarily small amount. Such patterns are often beautiful to behold and designs based on these arrangements have now been used in many buildings throughout the world.In this Ri event Sir Roger Penrose reveals the mathematical underpinnings and origins of these \"forbidden symmetries\" and other related patterns. His talk is illustrated with numerous examples of their use in architectural design including a novel version of \"Penrose tiling\" that appears in the approach to the main entrance of the new Mathematics Institute in Oxford, officially opened in late 2013 (http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/new-building). The tiling is constructed from several thousand diamond-shaped granite tiles of just two different shapes, decorated simply with circular arcs of stainless steel. The matching of the tiles forces them into an overall pattern which never repeats itself and exhibits remarkable aspects of 5-fold and 10-fold symmetry.Similar features have been found also in the atomic structures of quasi-crystalline materials. The initial discovery of such material earned Dan Shectman the 2011 Nobel Prize for chemistry, his work having launched a completely novel area of crystallography.

And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

For that, Rubin lost friends and gets protested at college campuses.While many leftists are so angry at Rubin, they will no longer talk to him, conservatives are eager to talk. Rubin says that surprised him because, \"Im pro-choice. Most of them are pro-life. Im against the death penalty, most of them are for the death penalty.\"Stossel had a similar experience: \"when I went from left to libertarian, the right was willing to argue,\" he tells Rubin.Why would that be? Rubin speculates that it comes down to treating people as individuals rather than groups. If you believe in the individual, then you fundamentally understand that individuals are different. So you are willing to sit down with someone different than you,\" he says.Rubin gets flak for talking with right-wing provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos, and for criticizing leftists.  When Rubin tried to give a speech at the University of New Hampshire, a gender studies professor screamed: \"we dont want you in the LGBT community (Rubin is gay), so get the f*** out.\" Another woman at the speech said Rubin is insensitive to victims. But when Rubin asked how she had been oppressed, she responded, \"I have no reason to tell you about my oppression because thats just like mental energy, unless Im going to be paid.\"Rubin calls the atmosphere on many campuses an \"Oppression Olympics\", where students and faculty compete to be the biggest victim. As a result, ideas that offend \"victims\" are often off limits for discussion.But Rubin says will not bow to political correctness.  He'll keep discussing uncomfortable ideas: \"I would rather live and stand for whatever I believe in than just bow forever.\""	38520	464	1020174	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/kl0-n0zWVJk/hqdefault.jpg"	7

I hope this letter finds you in good spirits as we navigate this truly surreal crisis. Since 2013, we at Letters Live have been inviting performers to bring letters to life in memorable venues around the world. With our Read A Letter campaign, were opening the stage extremely wide and would love for the world (you!) to share letters to the heroes on the frontline; letters to relatives in need; letters to strangers who have stepped up and made a difference; letters to neighbouring families, streets, towns and countries; letters from teachers to their isolated pupils or to the parents who now find themselves home-schooling; letters to those in power; letters to a population crying out for words of comfort. You could record yourself reading an important letter you have wanted to send, or a cherished letter you once received. It could be a favourite letter of yours that offers hope in our current crisis or a prescient warning too important to be ignored. It may simply be a favourite letter of yours that may brighten everyones day. (I am obliged to say that if youre not reading your own letter, you must, please, ask the letter writers permission.)  So, all you need to do is this: - Film yourself reading a letter. Use your phone, just as I am. - If you're camera shy, point your phone at something else while you read: the letter itself, the view from your window, your adorable dog. - Before you read the letter, tell us who its to and who its from, and if you can, tell us why youve chosen it. - Post the video to Twitter or Instagram or whichever corner of the internet you frequent, remembering to include the hashtag #ReadALetter and tag @letterslive so we can then share your reading. Alternatively, if you don't use social media, send the clip to read@letterslive.com so we can share the letter for you.- Spread the word by nominating another person to write a letter. Thats it. Thank you in advance for taking part. Stay connected. Stay safe. Stay at home. Yours in isolation, Benedict, and all at Letters Live"	7009	43	134718	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/noE6EMp2Kck/hqdefault.jpg"	7

But that almost reinforces for me how important it is to talk about this.I don't see a lot of content out there discussing narcissists or manipulative people, and even less on how to handle situations with those kinds of people.I tried my best to share my point of view and some of the things I learned.Thanks for watching.Instagram <U+2192> https://www.instagram.com/nathanieldr...Sign up to my newsletter here <U+0001F366><U+2192> https://www.nathanieldrew.com/newsletterAll of my gear <U+0001F4F7><U+2192> https://www.nathanieldrew.com/gearWhat I read (my book recommendations) <U+0001F4D6><U+2192> https://www.nathanieldrew.com/what-i-...#narcissist #whatIlearned #livingwithanarcissist"	52682	1077	1084856	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7cBf0WyzVWE/hqdefault.jpg"	4

"The New Optimism, with Matt Ridley, Johan Norberg, David Runciman and Laura Kuenssberg - YouTube"	"5snsXCYTbFk"	"Intelligence Squared"	"/channel/UCaqcvH8EvUtePORpN03jLMg"	250000	"Want to join the debate? Check out the Intelligence Squared website to hear about future live events and podcasts: http://www.intelligencesquared.com __________________________Are you an optimist or a pessimist? And why should it matter? After what for many of us has been an annus horribilis in 2016, pessimists seem to have all the best tunes. Terror attacks, horror headlines from Syria, a tide of hatred and resentment poisoning our politics: the world looks increasingly grim. But what about the actual facts? If you step back and examine the data, its clear that life is better today for the majority of people than at any previous time in history. And were not just talking about the developing world, where progress has been remarkable. Here in the West, most of us have never had it so good. Just look at the improvements in health and longevity, the breadth of entertainment available, and the opportunities to travel that we blithely take for granted.In this special Intelligence Squared event, we examined two fundamentally opposing worldviews. In the optimists corner were Matt Ridley, author of the prize-winning The Rational Optimist, and Johan Norberg, whose latest book is Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future. They argued that the progress that has been made over the past centuries  whether in education, child labour, poverty or violent deaths  is now running at an unprecedented pace and that there is every reason to think that it will continue for decades to come.But is their essentially rationalist approach one that can really explain what appears to be the conflict-ridden world we live in? After all, many of us have never felt so gloomy and perplexed. This tension is not new. It has run through mainstream political thought since the Enlightenment. It set rationalists such as Adam Smith and J. S. Mill against those who sought to interpret the darker side of human nature such as Rousseau and Dostoevsky. They have been joined more recently by behavioural economists such as Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler. For these latter thinkers, rationalism will always fail to give a full account of human behaviour. Exploring this line of thought in our event was the acclaimed political scientist David Runciman. And steering the discussion was the BBCs star political editor Laura Kuenssberg.Optimist or pessimist? Some say that pessimism is dangerous, as its the emotions of fear and nostalgia that are fertile breeding grounds for populist demagogues. Others argue that too optimistic a view can blind us to the real threats facing our freedoms and democracy."	220	20	22164	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5snsXCYTbFk/hqdefault.jpg"	7

Oceanographer John Englander, author of \"High Tide On Main Street\" explains why it is unstoppable, regardless of efforts to be 'green' and sustainable. Using powerful images, he encourages us to embrace the new reality that the shoreline is moving, that we begin to adapt, while we also try to slow the warming. It is a positive message, \"a glass half full, rather than half empty\" --  though the glass will get higher each decade.In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"	741	487	112121	"https://img.youtube.com/vi/TH8Q8Ki9fCA/hqdefault.jpg"	1
